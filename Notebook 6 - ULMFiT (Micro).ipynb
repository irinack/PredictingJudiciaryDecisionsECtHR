      "2.The applicant was represented by Ms G. Peirce a lawyer practising in London with Birnberg Peirce & Partners. She was assisted by MrE.Fitzgerald QC, Mr R. Husain QC and Mr D. Friedman, counsel. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, MsL.Dauban, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\n",
      "3.The applicant alleged, in particular, that he would be at real risk of illtreatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, and a flagrant denial of justice, contrary to Article 6 of the Convention, if he were deported to Jordan.\n",
      "4.On 19 February 2009 the President of the Chamber to which the application had been allocated decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings not to remove the applicant to Jordan pending the Court’s decision.\n",

In addition, third-party comments were received from the non-governmental organisations Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and JUSTICE, which had been given leave by the President of the Chamber to intervene in the written procedure (Article 36 2 of the Convention and Rule 44  2). The parties replied to those comments (Rule 44  5).\n",

      "THE FACTS\n",
      "I.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\n",
      "A.Introduction\n",
      "7.The applicant was born in 1960 near Bethlehem, then administered as part of the Kingdom of Jordan. He arrived in the United Kingdom in September 1993, having previously fled Jordan and gone to Pakistan. He made a successful application for asylum, the basis of which was first, that he had been detained and tortured in March 1988 and 1990-1991 by the Jordanian authorities and second, that he had been detained and later placed under house arrest on two further occasions. The applicant was recognised as a refugee on 30 June 1994 and granted leave to remain until 30June 1998. As is the normal practice, the Secretary of State did not give reasons for his decision for recognising the applicant as a refugee.\n",
      "8.On 8 May 1998 the applicant applied for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. This application had not been determined before the applicant’s arrest on 23 October 2002. On that date he was taken into detention under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (see A.and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 3455/05,  90, 19 February 2009). When that Act was repealed in March 2005, the applicant was released on bail and then made subject to a control order under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (ibid.,  83 and 84). On 11 August 2005, while his appeal against that control order was still pending, the Secretary of State served the applicant with a notice of intention to deport (see section 3, paragraph 25 below).\n",
      "B.Previous criminal proceedings in Jordan\n",
      "1.The Reform and Challenge Trial\n",
      "9.In April 1999, the applicant was convicted in absentia in Jordan of conspiracy to cause explosions, in a trial known as the “reform and challenge” case. He was the twelfth of thirteen defendants.\n",
      "10.The case involved an allegation of a conspiracy to carry out bombings in Jordan, which resulted in successful attacks on the American School and the Jerusalem Hotel in Amman in 1998. There were further convictions for offences of membership of a terrorist group, but these matters were the subject of a general amnesty. The applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the conclusion of the trial.\n",
      "11.During the trial, one witness, Mohamed Al-Jeramaine, confessed that he and not the defendants had been involved in the bombings. The State Security Court hearing the case took the view that his confession was false, and demonstrably so, because of discrepancies between what he said about the nature of the explosives, for example, and other technical evidence. MrAl-Jeramaine was later executed for homicides for which he had been convicted in another trial.\n",
      "12.The applicant maintains that the evidence against him was predominantly based upon an incriminating statement from a co-defendant, Abdul Nasser Al-Hamasher (also known as Al-Khamayseh). In his confession to the Public (or State) Prosecutor, Mr Al-Hamasher alleged that the applicant had provided prior encouragement for the attacks. He was also said to have congratulated the group after the attacks.\n",
      "13.Mr Al Hamasher, along with several other defendants, had complained during the proceedings before the State Security Court that they had been tortured by the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate (“the GID”), which shares responsibility for maintaining internal security and monitoring security threats in Jordan with the Public Security Directorate and the military. At the end of the period of interrogation during which they claimed to have been tortured, the Public Prosecutor took a statement from each defendant.\n",
      "14.At the trial there was evidence from lawyers and medical examiners and relatives of the defendants that there were visible signs of torture on the defendants. However, the State Security Court concluded that the defendants could not prove torture.\n",
      "15.There were a number of appeals to the Court of Cassation and remittals back to the State Security Court, although, as the applicant had been convicted in absentia, no appeals were taken on his behalf. In the course of those appeals, the convictions were upheld on the basis that the relevant statements had been made to the Public Prosecutor. The confessions in those statements thus constituted sufficient evidence for conviction if the court accepted them and if the Public Prosecutor was satisfied with the confessions. The Court of Cassation rejected the claim that the Public Prosecutor had to prove that the defendants had confessed to him of their own accord: the Public Prosecutor’s obligation to prove that a confession was obtained willingly only arose where the confession had not been obtained by him. The confessions in question were authentic and there was no evidence that they had been made under financial or moral coercion.\n",
      "16.The Court of Cassation then considered the impact of the allegations that the confessions to the State Prosecutor had resulted from coercion of the defendants and their families while they were in GID detention. Such conduct during an investigation was against Jordanian law and rendered the perpetrators liable to punishment. However, even assuming that the defendants’ allegations were true, that would not nullify the confessions made to the Public Prosecutor unless it were proved that those confessions were the consequence of illegal coercion to force the defendants to confess to things which they had not done. The defendants had not shown that was the case.\n",
      "17.As a result of the applicant’s conviction in this trial, the Jordanian authorities requested the applicant’s extradition from the United Kingdom. In early 2000, the request was withdrawn by Jordan.\n",
      "2.The millennium conspiracy trial\n",
      "18.In the autumn of 2000 the applicant was again tried in absentia in Jordan, this time in a case known as the “millennium conspiracy”, which concerned a conspiracy to cause explosions at western and Israeli targets in Jordan to coincide with the millennium celebrations. The conspiracy was uncovered before the attacks could be carried out. The applicant was alleged to have provided money for a computer and encouragement through his writings, which had been found at the house of a co-defendant, MrAbuHawsher. The applicant maintains that the main evidence against him was the testimony of Abu Hawsher.\n",
      "19.Most of the defendants were convicted on most charges; some were fully or partly acquitted. The applicant was convicted and sentenced to 15years’ imprisonment with hard labour. Other defendants, including AbuHawsher, were sentenced to death. On appeal certain of the defendants, including, it appears, Abu Hawsher, claimed to have been tortured during 50days of interrogation when they were denied access to lawyers. The Court of Cassation rejected this ground of appeal, holding that the minutes of interrogation showed that each defendant had been told of his right to remain silent about the charges unless their lawyer was present. The applicant also states that the Court of Cassation found that the alleged ill-treatment in GID custody was irrelevant because the State Security Court did not rely on the defendants’ confessions to the GID but their confessions to the Public Prosecutor. Abu Hawsher remains under sentence of death.\n",
      "20.The findings of the United Kingdom Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) in respect of the evidence presented at each trial are set out at paragraph 45 below. The further evidence which has become available since SIAC’s findings, and which has been submitted to this Court, is summarised as paragraphs 94–105 below.\n",
      "C.The agreement of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the United Kingdom and Jordan\n",
      "21.In October 2001, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advised the United Kingdom Government that Article 3 of the Convention precluded the deportation of terrorist suspects to Jordan. In March 2003, after a Government review of the possibility of removing such barriers to removal, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that its advice of October 2001 remained extant but that it was considering whether key countries would be willing and able to provide the appropriate assurances to guarantee that potential deportees would be treated in a manner consistent with the United Kingdom’s obligations. In May 2003, the Foreign Secretary agreed that seeking specific and credible assurances from foreign governments, in the form of memoranda of understanding, might be a way of enabling deportation from the United Kingdom.\n",
      "22.In November 2003, the British Embassy in Amman was instructed to raise the idea of a framework memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Jordanian Government. In February 2005, after meetings between the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the King of Jordan, and between the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the Jordanian Foreign Minister, agreement was reached on the principle of an MOU.\n",
      "23.Further negotiations took place in June 2005 and an MOU was signed on 10 August 2005. That MOU set out a series of assurances of compliance with international human rights standards, which would be adhered to when someone was returned to one State from the other (see paragraph 76 below). The same day, a side letter from the United Kingdom Charg d’Affaires, Amman, to the Jordanian Ministry of the Interior was signed, which recorded the Jordanian Government’s ability to give assurances in individual cases that the death penalty would not be imposed. In respect of the applicant, further questions as to the conduct of any retrial he would face after deportation were also put to the Jordanian Government and answered in May 2006 by the Legal Adviser at the Jordanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n",
      "24.The MOU also made provision for any person returned under it to contact and have prompt and regular visits from a representative of an independent body nominated jointly by the United Kingdom and Jordanian Governments. On 24 October 2005, the Adaleh Centre for Human Rights Studies (“the Adaleh Centre”) signed a monitoring agreement with the United Kingdom Government. On 13 February 2006, the terms of reference for the Adaleh Centre were agreed (see paragraph 80 below).\n",
      "D.The applicant’s appeal against deportation\n",
      "25.On 11 August 2005, that is, the day after the MOU was signed, the Secretary of State served the applicant with the notice of intention to deport. The Secretary of State certified that the decision to deport the applicant was taken in the interests of national security. The applicant appealed to SIAC against that decision arguing, inter alia, that it was incompatible with Articles 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the Convention. Relying on his previous asylum claim, he argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the Jordanian authorities. If returned, he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted in absentia. He would thus face lengthy pre-trial detention (in breach of Article 5) and, if convicted, would face a long term of imprisonment. All these factors meant he was at real risk of torture, either pre-trial or after conviction, to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons. He was also at risk of the death penalty or rendition to other countries, such as the United States of America. Relying on Article 6, he alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair: the State Security Court, a military court, lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture – either of him, his co-defendants or other prisoners – would be admitted against him.\n",
      "1.Proceedings before SIAC\n",
      "(a)The conduct of proceedings before SIAC and its national security findings\n",
      "26.The applicant’s appeal was dismissed by SIAC on 26 February 2007. The appeal had been heard by SIAC in two parts: an “open session”, where the Secretary of State’s case and evidence was presented in the presence of the applicant and his representatives, and a “closed session” where parts of the Secretary of State’s case which could not be disclosed for security reasons were presented (see paragraph 69 below). SIAC heard evidence in closed session relating to the process by which the MOU had been agreed, the extent to which it would mitigate the risk of torture and also evidence as to the national security threat the applicant was alleged to have posed to the United Kingdom (“closed material”). In the closed sessions, the applicant and his representatives were excluded but his interests were represented by special advocates. SIAC then delivered an “open judgment”, which is publicly available, and a “closed judgment”, which was given only to the Secretary of State and the special advocates.\n",
      "27.In reaching its decision as to whether the applicant’s deportation was necessary in the interests of national security, SIAC considered the Secretary of State’s case to be “well proved” since the applicant was regarded by many terrorists as a spiritual adviser whose views legitimised acts of violence. However, SIAC did not take into account either of the applicant’s Jordanian convictions in absentia, which were originally advanced as part of the Government’s case. The reason for this was that the Government had adopted what was described as a “pragmatic approach” in withdrawing reliance upon any evidence which it was alleged might have been obtained by torture on the grounds that it would require an investigation as to whether it was obtained by torture. This was done in accordance the House of Lords’ ruling in A. and others (no. 2) to that effect (see paragraphs 136 and 137 below).\n",
      "28.SIAC then reviewed the evidence it had heard from various sources including a senior United Kingdom diplomat, Mr Mark Oakden, who gave evidence on the negotiation of the MOU, the monitoring agreement with the Adaleh Centre and on the risk faced by the applicant in Jordan. On behalf of the applicant, it heard evidence on the Jordanian regime from three academics. It also received evidence from an Arabic speaking barrister, MsRana Refahi, who had travelled to Jordan to conduct research on the previous two trials including interviews with the defendants and their lawyers. Additionally, it considered evidence of the United States Government’s interest in the applicant and allegations that a Jordanian national had been the subject of extraordinary rendition from Jordan to the United States.\n",
      "(b)SIAC’s findings on the MOU\n",
      "29.SIAC found that this Court’s judgments in Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V and Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, ECHR 2005I, showed that reliance could lawfully be placed on assurances; but the weight to be given depended on the circumstances of each case. There was a difference between relying on an assurance which required a State to act in a way which would not accord with its normal law and an assurance which required a State to adhere to what its law required but which might not be fully or regularly observed in practice. Referring to a decision of the United Nations Committee Against Torture, Agiza v. Sweden (see paragraph 147 below), where the Swedish authorities had expelled an Egyptian national after receiving assurances from Egypt, SIAC continued:\n",
      "“The case of Agiza stands as a clear warning of the dangers of simple reliance on a form of words and diplomatic monitoring. There were already warning signs which ought to have alerted the Swedish authorities to the risks, including the role they had permitted to a foreign intelligence organisation. But we note what to us are the crucial differences: the strength, duration and depth of the bilateral relationship between the two countries by comparison with any that has been pointed to between Sweden and Egypt; the way in which the negotiations over the MOU have proceeded and the diplomatic assessment of their significance; the particular circumstances of [the present applicant] and Jordan; the degree of risk at the various stages, in the absence of the MOU, particularly at the early stages of detention which is when the risk from torture by the GID would normally be at its greatest and when the confirmed torture of Agiza in Egypt appears to have occurred; and the speed with which the monitors would be seeking and we believe obtaining access to the Appellant in those early days. The Swedes felt that to seek to see Agiza would betray a want of confidence in the Egyptians, whereas there is no such feeling in either the UK, the [Adaleh] Centre or the Jordanian Government. Quite the reverse applies. One aspect of that case which also troubled the [Committee Against Torture] was that Agiza had been removed without final judicial determination of his case. That would not be the position here.”\n",
      "30.In the present case, the political situation in Jordan and the freedom, albeit limited, of non-governmental organisations, the press and Parliament to express concerns would reduce the risks the applicant faced. In addition, the level of scrutiny Jordan had accepted under the MOU could not but show that it was willing to abide by its terms and spirit. Each country had a real interest in preventing breaches of the MOU: the diplomatic relationship between the United Kingdom and Jordan was friendly and long-standing and of real value to Jordan and it would have a real incentive to avoid being seen as having broken its word. Both countries had an interest in maintaining co-operation on counter-terrorism matters. The United Kingdom had a very real concern that it should be able to remove foreign nationals without breaching their rights under Article 3, so failure in such a highly publicised case would be a major setback for that process. That concern would thus act as a further incentive to investigate any breaches of the MOU. While the MOU did not specify what steps would be taken in such an investigation, SIAC accepted evidence from the Mr Oakden that any failure of the Jordanian Government to respond to diplomatic queries would lead to “rapidly escalating diplomatic and Ministerial contacts and reactions”.\n",
      "31.SIAC accepted that there were some weaknesses in the MOU and monitoring provisions. Some protections, such as prompt access to a lawyer, recorded interviews, independent medical examinations and prohibition on undisclosed places of detention, were not explicitly present but, in reality, most of these aspects were covered. There was no guarantee that access to the applicant, as required by the Adaleh Centre’s terms of reference, would always be granted but any refusal would be brought to light quite quickly; in the early period of detention, the Centre was expected to visit the applicant three times a week. SIAC also expected the GID and the Jordanian Government to react swiftly to any approach by the United Kingdom were a visit to be refused. It was “disturbing” that the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture had been refused access to a GID facility in June 2006, despite a prior arrangement that he would be permitted free access. However, on the evidence it had heard, SIAC found that there was no real risk of ill-treatment of the applicant by the GID. There was a weakness in the Adaleh Centre’s “relative inexperience and scale”; it would be undertaking a task which would be new to it; and it did not have the expertise among its staff, as it had recognised. It was a fairly new body with limited resources and staff, although this could be overcome and the United Kingdom Government would bear the cost. It was the very fact of monitoring visits which was important and the absence of specialist expertise was not fatal to their value.\n",
      "(c)SIAC’s findings on Article 3\n",
      "32.The United Kingdom Government did not contest the general thrust of the available material in relation to Jordan’s human rights record and, in SIAC’s view, details of human rights violations in Jordan remained relevant to the assessment of the risk faced by the applicant. The Government also took the position that it could not return the applicant to Jordan, in conformity with its international obligations, in the absence of the particular measures contained in the MOU. Nevertheless, SIAC found it important to consider the risks faced by the applicant by reference to the likely sequence of events if he were to be returned. It found that the MOU might not be necessary for each risk but rather reinforce the protection available.\n",
      "33.SIAC accepted that, on return, the applicant would be taken into the custody of the GID and retried on the two charges for which he had been convicted in absentia. He would be accompanied by a representative of the Adaleh Centre to his place of detention and be medically examined. SIAC also accepted that the GID would interrogate the applicant with a view to obtaining a confession for use at trial and for more general intelligence purposes, though SIAC found it to be speculative that GID would interrogate the applicant about other offences in order to bring further charges against him; there was no evidence of any other charges outstanding. SIAC also accepted that the United States would seek to question the applicant and that this would take place soon after his arrival in Jordan. However, there was no real risk that Article 3 would be breached before the conclusion of the retrial.\n",
      "34.There was a real risk of torture or ill-treatment of an “ordinary Islamist extremist” in GID detention before charge since such ill-treatment was widespread and longstanding and there was a climate of impunity and evasion of international monitoring in the GID. However, the applicant would be protected by his high profile, by the MOU and the monitoring agreement, especially since the Adaleh Centre would be “keen to prove its mettle” and would itself be subject to the vigilance of other nongovernmental organisations. This would also prevent any real risk of the use by the GID of tactics such as last-minute refusals of access, claims that the applicant did not wish to see the monitors or moving him elsewhere without notification. Access by the Adaleh Centre would also prevent the applicant’s incommunicado detention.\n",
      "35.The MOU would also counteract the climate of impunity prevailing in the GID and toleration of torture by its senior members. The MOU and the monitoring arrangements were supported at the highest levels in Jordan – the King of Jordan’s political power and prestige were behind the MOU – so it was reasonable to assume that instructions on how to treat the applicant had been given to the GID and it would be aware that any breaches would not go unpunished. Moreover, senior members of the GID had participated in the MOU negotiations and therefore would know the consequences of any failure to comply. Even if abuses were normally the work of rogue officers, the specific and unusual position of the applicant and the effect of the MOU would lead to senior officers preventing ill-treatment in his case, even if they did so only out of self-interest.\n",
      "36.Questioning by the United States was not forbidden by the MOU and, to SIAC, it was probable that the United States Central Intelligence Agency would be allowed to question the applicant directly with the GID present. However, the United Kingdom would have made clear to the United States its interests in ensuring that the MOU was not breached. The Jordanian authorities and United States would be careful to ensure that the United States did not “overstep the mark”. Assuming that the applicant remained in GID custody and was not surrendered to the United States, there would be no real risk of ill-treatment at the pre-trial stage. It was also highly unlikely that the applicant would be placed in any secret GID or CIA detention facility in Jordan.\n",
      "37.The same factors applied to any questioning which might take place soon after the conviction or acquittal of the applicant. The MOU would continue to apply and it would be in the interests of both the Jordanians and the Americans to conduct any interrogation at the earliest opportunity rather than wait until after trial. The applicant’s high profile was also found to be “unlikely to diminish much for some years”.\n",
      "38.There was little likelihood of the Jordanian authorities bringing any subsequent charges which carried the death penalty or seeking the death penalty in respect of the charges for which the applicant was to be retried. Instead, if he were convicted, the applicant would face a lengthy period of imprisonment. There was a real risk of a life sentence in respect of the Reform and Challenge conspiracy, although there was a greater prospect that it would be considerably less because of the way in which sentences on the other defendants appeared to have been reduced on appeal, to 4 or 5 years. There was no real risk of a life sentence in the millennium conspiracy retrial. There was no rule that would prevent a higher sentence being imposed than the 15 year sentence that had been imposed in absentia. However, the clear practice was against imposing higher sentences in retrials following initial convictions in absentia and there was no reason why a more unfavourable view would be taken of the applicant when he was present than when he was absent. The applicant would serve any sentence in an ordinary prison and not a GID detention facility; the sentence of hard labour did not connote any additional punishment. General conditions would not breach Article 3 and, although beatings sometimes occurred, there was no evidence that the applicant would be targeted as a political Islamist prisoner. His status would again act to protect him.\n",
      "39.In respect of rendition, there were “powerful incentives” for the Jordanian and United States Governments not to allow this to happen, not least the real domestic political difficulties this would create for the Jordanian Government and the unwillingness of the United States to destabilise the Jordanian regime. Any instances of alleged rendition from Jordan had involved people of other nationalities or, in one case, of a dual US/Jordanian national. It was also very unlikely that the applicant would be removed to a secret CIA facility in Jordan since this would require the connivance of the Jordanian authorities contrary to the MOU. It was also unlikely that the United States Government would seek the extradition of the applicant from Jordan when it had not sought his extradition from the United Kingdom and there would be political difficulties for Jordan to accede to such a request.\n",
      "(d)SIAC’s findings on Article 5\n",
      "40.In relation to the applicant’s detention following his removal to Jordan, SIAC found that the time limits for notifying the legal authorities of an arrest (48 hours) and for bringing formal charges (15 days) were regularly and lawfully extended by the courts at the request of the prosecutor, in stages of up to 15 days to a maximum of 50 days. It would therefore be compatible with Jordanian law for the applicant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a court before being charged. Such extensions were approved by a judicial authority, although not necessarily in the physical presence of the suspect.\n",
      "41.SIAC noted that the MOU did not explicitly require that there be no extensions of time beyond the initial 15 day detention but required that a returned person be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorised by law to determine the lawfulness of his detention. Though “promptly” was not defined in the MOU, SIAC found that this part of the MOU would be carried out, particularly since this was one of the earliest points at which the MOU would be engaged, and that the applicant’s first appearance before a judicial authority would be within 48 hours. It would not breach the MOU if the applicant were to be detained for a maximum of 50 days, by means of judicially approved 15 day extensions, or if he were absent when those later decisions were taken. However, in reality the total period of 50 days was unlikely to be sought, even without the MOU, because the applicant faced a retrial and the case dossiers had already been through the trial and appeal process a number of times.\n",
      "(e)SIAC’s findings on Article 6\n",
      "42.It was common ground before SIAC that the applicant’s previous convictions would be set aside and he would face retrial before the State Security Court on the same charges.\n",
      "43.In addition to his two challenges to the retrial process (the impartiality of the State Security Court and the use of evidence obtained by torture) the applicant also argued that he would be questioned in detention without the presence of a lawyer by the GID, United States officials or the Public Prosecutor. The latter had the power under Article 64(3) of the Jordanian Criminal Trial Procedures Code to conduct an investigation in the absence of a lawyer “whenever he [deemed] it necessary in order to reveal the truth”. This decision was not subject to review, though SIAC also noted that a confession before the Public Prosecutor was not admissible unless the individual had been warned that he need not answer questions without his lawyer present. SIAC thought it unlikely that the applicant would have a lawyer present during questioning by the GID or United States officials but very likely he would have access to a lawyer for any appearance before a judge or the Public Prosecutor. In terms of pre-trial preparation by the defence, the period and facilities available would be less extensive than in the United Kingdom but nonetheless better than would normally be the case in Jordan.\n",
      "44.With regard to the lack of independence and impartiality of the State Security Court, SIAC found that the court would consist of three judges, at least two of whom would be legally qualified military officers with no security of tenure. The Public Prosecutor would also be a military officer. Appeal would lie to the Court of Cassation, a civilian court, though that court could not hear argument on any unfairness of the trial arising from the military composition of the State Security Court.\n",
      "45.As to the potential use of evidence obtained by torture in the applicant’s retrial, SIAC found as follows:\n",
      "“418.The Jordanian legal system, by its terms, does not therefore permit the use of involuntary confession or incriminatory statements. There is a judicial examination of allegations of that nature before the evidence is admitted. Those allegations can themselves be tested by evidence. How far those allegations can be practicably tested is affected by certain features of the system. The burden of proof for excluding confessions made to the Prosecutor lies on the defendant. There is obvious difficulty in proving prior acts or threats by the GID in the absence of systems for recording questioning, for ensuring the presence of lawyers during questioning, and independent prompt medical examinations. There is likely to be considerable reluctance on the part of the Court to accept that confessions to the Prosecutor, a common source of evidence, are tainted by ill-treatment. The Court or Prosecutor does not appear prepared to compel the appearance of GID officials to testify about these allegations. There may be a sense that these allegations are made routinely, as a matter of defence strategy.\n",
      "419.There may well be a greater willingness to test the nature of confessions made only in the course of GID questioning. There is some evidence that at least at Court of Cassation level, confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture have been excluded, (though it is not clear whether those were made to the GID or to the Prosecutor).\n",
      "420.However, the general background evidence and that specific to the two trials in question shows that there is at least a very real risk that the incriminating statements against the [applicant] were obtained as a result of treatment by the GID which breached Article 3 ECHR; it may or may not have amounted to torture. It is very improbable that those statements would be excluded on the retrial, because the SSCt is unlikely to be persuaded that they were so obtained, particularly having already rejected that assertion at the first trials, although the makers could give evidence that they were so obtained and were in fact untrue.”\n",
      "There was, therefore, a high probability that the past statements made to the Public Prosecutor which incriminated the applicant would be admitted. SIAC further found that those statements would be of considerable, perhaps decisive, importance against him. On this aspect of the retrial, SIAC held:\n",
      "“439.To us, the question comes back to whether or not it is unfair for the burden of proof in Jordan to lie where it does on this issue; we do not think that to be unfair in itself. However, this burden of proof appears to be unaccompanied by some of the basic protections against prior ill-treatment or means of assisting its proof eg video or other recording of questioning by the GID, limited periods of detention for questioning, invariable presence of lawyers, routine medical examination, assistance from the Court in calling relevant officials or doctors. The decisions are also made by a court which lacks independence and does not appear to examine closely or vigorously allegations of this nature. It is taking these points in combination which leads us to conclude that the trial would be likely to be unfair within Article 6 because of the way the allegations about involuntary statements would be considered.”\n",
      "46.SIAC concluded that, despite its findings in respect of the independence and impartiality of the State Security Court and the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained contrary to Article 3, there would be no flagrant denial of justice under Article 6 of the Convention if the applicant were retried in Jordan. SIAC stated that the retrial would take place “within a legally constructed framework covering the court system, the procedural rules and the offences”, the applicant would be present and it would be in public. The dossier from the original trial would be before the retrial court but the applicant could effectively challenge its contents. The execution of Al-Jeramaine and the difficulty faced by other witnesses, notably Abu Hawsher, would not make the retrial unfair. SIAC concluded:\n",
      "“446.We accept the lack of institutional independence in the SSCt. The lack of independence for SSCt Judges is in the structure and system. There is no evidence as to why particular judges might be chosen for particular cases, or that they are ‘leaned on’. But the SSCt is not a mere tool of the executive: there is sound evidence that it appraises the evidence and tests it against the law, and acquits a number of defendants. It has reduced sentences over time.\n",
      "447.Its judges have legal training and are career military lawyers. There is a very limited basis beyond that for saying that they would be partial, and that has not been the gravamen of the complaint. Their background may well make them sceptical about allegations of abuse by the GID affecting statements made to the Prosecutor. They may instinctively share the view that allegations of ill-treatment are a routine part of a defence case to excuse the incrimination of others. The legal framework is poorly geared to detecting and acting upon allegations of abuse. The way in which it approaches the admission of evidence, on the material we have, shows no careful scrutiny of potentially tainted evidence. There would be considerable publicity given to the retrial and public trials can encourage greater care and impartiality in the examination of the evidence. This would not be a mere show trial, nor were the first trials; nor would the result be a foregone conclusion, regardless of the evidence.\n",
      "448.Reasons are given for the decisions, and an appeal to the Court of Cassation is available. The fact that such an appeal cannot cure the want of structural independence in the SSCt is not a reason for discounting its existence in the overall assessment of whether there would be a complete denial of Article 6 rights. This Court is a civilian court and the evidence of undue executive influence through appointment or removal is quite sparse. There is no evidence again as to how its panels are chosen, nor that they are “leaned on” by the executive. It plainly operates as a corrective to the rulings of the SSCt on law and procedure, and is of some relevance to factual matters, even though it does not hear the evidence all over again or have a full factual jurisdiction except on Prosecutors’ appeals. The probable sentences are not wholly disproportionate to the offences.\n",
      "449.We have discussed at length the approach of the SSCt to the admission of statements to a prosecutor allegedly given as a result of prior ill-treatment. Although we take the view that a contribution of factors would probably make the retrial unfair in that respect, they do not constitute a complete denial of a fair trial. The existence of a legal prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence cannot be ignored, nor the fact that the SSCt would hear evidence relating to the allegations. The role of the Court of Cassation in reviewing and at times overturning the conclusions of the SSCt on this issue is material. The want of evidential or procedural safeguards to balance the burden of proof, and the probable cast of mind towards statements made to a prosecutor/judge in a civil law system, all within a security court dominated by military lawyers, does not suffice for a complete denial of justice.\n",
      "450.There is a danger, given the inevitable focus on what is said to be potentially unfair about the retrial, in focussing exclusively on deficiencies when deciding whether there would be a total denial of the right to a fair trial, rather than looking at the picture of the trial as a whole. That is what has to be done however and it is that picture as a whole which has led us to our conclusion on this issue.\n",
      "451.The various factors which would be likely to cause the retrial to breach Article 6 are to a considerable degree interlinked. Taking them in the round does not persuade us that there is a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial.”\n",
      "47.Finally, while there was the real prospect of a long term of imprisonment, this did not alter SIAC’s conclusion that the overall nature of the retrial would not be a total denial of the applicant’s rights.\n",
      "2.Proceedings before the Court of Appeal\n",
      "48.The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which gave judgment on 9 April 2008, unanimously allowing the appeal in respect of Article 6 and the risk of the use of evidence obtained contrary to Article 3 and dismissing it on all other grounds ([2008] EWCA Civ 290).\n",
      "49.For the applicant’s complaints under Article 3 as to the use of closed evidence by SIAC and the reliance on the assurances in the MOU, the Court of Appeal considered it was bound by its previous ruling on these questions in MT (Algeria), RB (Algeria), U (Algeria) v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] EWCA Civ 808, which had found that: (i) SIAC could consider closed evidence on safety on return; and (ii) the relevance of assurances to safety on return was a matter of fact not law and thus it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on that ground. The Court of Appeal also rejected the applicant’s appeals based on Article 5, finding that SIAC was entitled to find as it did.\n",
      "50.For Article 6, the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s argument that there was a real risk of a “flagrant denial of justice” in his retrial in Jordan by reason of a lack of independence and or impartiality of the State Security Court: SIAC had been entitled to find as it did on this point and this conclusion was not altered by the later decision of this Court in AlMoayad v. Germany (dec.), no. 35865/03, 20 February 2007.\n",
      "51.However, the Court of Appeal accepted the applicant’s argument that there was a real risk that he would suffer a “flagrant denial of justice” by reason of the risk that statements obtained through treatment contrary to Article 3 would be admitted as evidence against him in his retrial. The Court of Appeal observed:\n",
      "“45.SIAC understated or misunderstood the fundamental nature in Convention law of the prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by torture. Counsel for the Secretary of State said that it was no part of his submission to say that if it is clear that a trial will take place on the basis of evidence obtained under torture, whether of the individual themselves, or third parties, that that would not involve flagrant denial of justice. Accordingly, once SIAC had found as a fact that there was a high probability that evidence that may very well have been obtained by torture (SIAC,  436); or in respect of which there was a very real risk that it had been obtained by torture or other conduct breaching article 3 (SIAC,  437); would be admitted at the trial of MrOthman; then SIAC had to be satisfied that such evidence would be excluded or not acted on. The grounds relied on by SIAC for not finding a threatened breach of article 6 in that respect were insufficient.\n",
      "46.We emphasise that that is not or not primarily a criticism of SIAC’s reasoning in terms of rationality, though we do consider additionally that SIAC’s conclusions did not follow rationally from its findings of fact. Rather, our principal finding is that SIAC erred by applying an insufficiently demanding test to determine the issue of whether article 6 rights would be breached.\n",
      "...\n",
      "48.The use of evidence obtained by torture is prohibited in Convention law not just because that will make the trial unfair, but also and more particularly because of the connexion of the issue with article 3, a fundamental, unconditional and non-derogable prohibition that stands at the centre of the Convention protections. As the ECtHR put it in 105 of its judgment in Jalloh v Germany 44 EHRR 32:\n",
      "‘incriminating evidence-whether in the form of a confession or real evidence-obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture-should never be relied on as proof of the victim’s guilt, irrespective of its probative value. Any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of Art.3 of the Convention sought to proscribe or, as it was so well put in the US Supreme Court’s judgment in the Rochin case 342 US 165, “to afford brutality the cloak of law”.’\n",
      "That view, that the use of evidence obtained by torture or ill-treatment is prohibited not just, or indeed primarily, because of its likely unreliability, but rather because the state must stand firm against the conduct that has produced the evidence, is universally recognised both within and outside Convention law.\n",
      "What is, with respect, a particularly strong statement to that effect, citing a multitude of equally strongly worded authorities, is to be found in 17 of the speech of Lord Bingham in A v Home Secretary (No2) [2006] 2 AC 221.\n",
      "49.SIAC was wrong not to recognise this crucial difference between breaches of article 6 based on this ground and breaches of article 6 based simply on defects in the trial process or in the composition of the court. Rather, in its conclusions in 442452 of its determination... it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the independence of the court: see in particular SIAC at  449-450. That caused it not to recognise the high degree of assurance that is required in relation to proceedings in a foreign state before a person may lawfully be deported to face a trial that may involve evidence obtained by torture.”\n",
      "52.The Court of Appeal noted that SIAC had reached its conclusion that there would not be a complete denial of justice in relation to the use of evidence obtained by torture by relying on the process, admittedly not wholly satisfactory, before the State Security Court and the Court of Cassation. For the Court of Appeal that conclusion sat very ill with SIAC’s own findings about the State Security Court process, in particular SIAC’s own concern as to the difficulties in proving that evidence had been obtained by torture. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, SIAC’s concern was “amply justified by the litany of lack of the basic protections against prior ill-treatment” in Jordan. It also criticised SIAC’s “disturbing failure” to give proper weight to the findings as to the defects in the State Security Court. The Court of Appeal concluded:\n",
      "“It was not open to SIAC to conclude on that evidence that the risk of the total denial of justice that is represented by the use of evidence obtained by torture had been adequately excluded. SIAC could not have so concluded if it had properly understood the status in Convention law of this aspect of article 6.”\n",
      "3.Proceedings before the House of Lords\n",
      "53.The Secretary of State appealed to the House of Lords in relation to the Court of Appeal’s conclusion on Article 6. The applicant cross-appealed in relation to his other Convention complaints. The appeal was heard with the appeals of two of the appellants in MT (Algeria), RB and U (see paragraph 48 above). In the conjoined appeals the House of Lords was therefore able to consider the use of closed material before SIAC, the reliance on the assurances contained in the MOU and the applicant’s Articles5 and 6 complaints. The House of Lords gave judgment on 18February 2009 unanimously allowing the Government’s appeal and dismissing the applicant’s cross-appeal ([2009] UKHL 10).\n",
      "(a)Article 3: the “closed” proceedings before SIAC\n",
      "54.Lord Phillips held that SIAC was lawfully entitled to consider closed material in evaluating safety on return and there were cogent considerations of policy for doing so. A distinction had to be drawn between closed material on safety on return and the use of closed material in other proceedings, for example to establish the national security threat posed by an individual. For the former, the individual would normally be aware of the nature of any risk on return and, in any event, it was for the individual himself, and not the State, to make out his case on whether he would be at risk on return. It was not likely to be critically important for a special advocate to be able to obtain input from the person to be deported in relation to closed evidence. As regards the impracticality of obtaining an appropriate expert witness with security clearance to see the material, Lord Phillips did not regard the problem as unfair. SIAC’s rules of procedure enabled the special advocate to ask SIAC to call for more evidence and SIAC, as an expert tribunal, could be relied upon “to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate’s submission”. In respect of the assurances, Lord Phillips endorsed the view that the assurances contained in the MOU had to be disclosed but details of the negotiations leading to the MOU could be closed material.\n",
      "55.Lord Hoffmann rejected the applicant’s argument on the more fundamental basis that he viewed this Court’s case-law as making it clear that the determination whether a deportation order might infringe Article 3 did not require “the full judicial panoply of article 6 or even 5(4)”. Citing Chahal, cited above, he emphasised that all that was required was “independent scrutiny of the claim”, which had occurred in the applicant’s case.\n",
      "56.Lord Hope agreed, albeit accepting that this Court had not yet had the opportunity to analyse whether the SIAC system met the requirements of the Convention. In his view, it did so. Lord Brown also agreed, emphasising that with regard to safety on return, no case was being made against the applicant; rather it was he who was making a case against the returning State.\n",
      "(b)Article 3: assurances and the MOU\n",
      "57.Lord Phillips (with whom the other Law Lords agreed) construed the this Court’s case-law from Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, onwards as treating assurances “as part of the matrix that had to be considered” when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would face treatment contrary to Article 3. He referred to the “abundance” of international law material, which supported the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by State agents was endemic. However, for Lord Phillips this came “close to a ‘Catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you cannot rely on them”. In rejecting that proposition, he held that the only basis to interfere with the view of SIAC was if its conclusions that the assurances could be relied upon were irrational and SIAC’s conclusions in the present case were not.\n",
      "(c)Article 5\n",
      "58.The House of Lords unanimously refused to interfere with the finding of fact by SIAC that the applicant’s exposure under Jordanian law to 50 days’ detention without access to a court or a lawyer, would not arise. Lord Phillips found that, even if it would arise, 50 days’ detention would not constitute a flagrant breach of Article 5. A flagrant breach was a breach whose consequences were so severe that they overrode the right of a State to expel an alien from its territory. That might be satisfied by arbitrary detention which lasted many years but not 50 days’ detention.\n",
      "(d)Article 6\n",
      "59.On Article 6, taking the test to be whether there would be a “complete denial or nullification” of the right to a fair trial, Lord Phillips observed:\n",
      "“136.This is neither an easy nor an adequate test of whether article 6 should bar the deportation of an alien. In the first place it is not easy to postulate what amounts to ‘a complete denial or nullification of the right to a fair trial’. That phrase cannot require that every aspect of the trial process should be unfair. ... What is required is that the deficiency or deficiencies in the trial process should be such as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of the prospective trial.\n",
      "137.In the second place, the fact that the deportee may find himself subject in the receiving country to a legal process that is blatantly unfair cannot, of itself, justify placing an embargo on his deportation. The focus must be not simply on the unfairness of the trial process but on its potential consequences. An unfair trial is likely to lead to the violation of substantive human rights and the extent of that prospective violation must plainly be an important factor in deciding whether deportation is precluded.”\n",
      "60.Having reviewed, the relevant case-law of this Court, including Bader and Kanbor v. Sweden, no. 13284/04,  42, ECHR 2005XI, which he took to exemplify the need to consider the risk of a violation of Article 6 in combination with other Articles such as Articles 2 and 3, Lord Phillips found:\n",
      "“[T]he Strasbourg jurisprudence, tentative though it is, has led me to these conclusions. Before the deportation of an alien will be capable of violating article 6 there must be substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk (i) that there will be a fundamental breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 and (ii) that this failure will lead to a miscarriage of justice that itself constitutes a flagrant violation of the victim’s fundamental rights.”\n",
      "61.In the present case, the second limb was met by the potential sentences of imprisonment the applicant faced. For the first limb, Lord Phillips concluded that, although the military constitution of the Jordanian State Security Court would render the trial contrary to Article 6 if it were held in a Convention State, he agreed with SIAC and the Court of Appeal, that it could not amount to a “flagrant denial of justice” sufficient to prevent deportation in a removal case.\n",
      "62.In respect of the applicant’s complaint that there was a real risk that the evidence against him had been obtained by torture, Lord Phillips held that the Court of Appeal erred. It had required too high a degree of assurance that evidence that might have been obtained by torture would not be used in a foreign trial. He stated:\n",
      "“[T]he prohibition on receiving evidence obtained by torture is not primarily because such evidence is unreliable or because the reception of the evidence will make the trial unfair. Rather it is because ‘the state must stand firm against the conduct that produced the evidence’. That principle applies to the state in which an attempt is made to adduce such evidence. It does not require this state, the United Kingdom, to retain in this country to the detriment of national security a terrorist suspect unless it has a high degree of assurance that evidence obtained by torture will not be adduced against him in Jordan... The issue before SIAC was whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that if Mr Othman were deported to Jordan the criminal trial that he would there face would have defects of such significance as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of his trial or, as SIAC put it, to amount to a total denial of the right to a fair trial. SIAC concluded that the deficiencies that SIAC had identified did not meet that exacting test. I do not find that in reaching this conclusion SIAC erred in law.”\n",
      "63.Lord Hoffmann found that there was no Convention authority for the rule that, in the context of the application of Article 6 to a removal case, the risk of the use of evidence obtained by torture necessarily amounted to a flagrant denial of justice.\n",
      "64.Lord Hope agreed. He accepted that this Court had adopted an “uncompromising approach” to the use at trial of evidence obtained by torture but the evidence before SIAC did not come up to that standard. There were allegations but no proof. The assertion that there was a real risk that the evidence was obtained by torture was not enough to prohibit removal. He recalled SIAC’s findings that the retrial would probably not comply with Article 6 if Jordan were a party to the Convention but would take place within a legally constructed framework. There was sound evidence that the State Security Court, which was not a mere tool of the executive, appraised the evidence and tested it against the law. SIAC had therefore been entitled to find as it did on the evidence.\n",
      "65.Lord Brown agreed with Lord Phillips and, referring to the majority of the Grand Chamber in Mamatkulov and Askarov, cited above, stated: “if extradition was not unlawful even in the circumstances arising there, in my judgment expulsion most certainly is not unlawful here.”\n",
      "66.Lord Mance, who agreed with the other Law Lords on Article 6 and all other points of appeal, noted a considerable resemblance between the concept of “flagrant unfairness” in this Court’s case-law and the concept of denial of justice in public international law generally. For the latter, the modern consensus was that the factual circumstances had to be egregious for State responsibility to arise in international law.\n",
      "II.RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICE\n",
      "A.SIAC’s procedures\n",
      "67.As stated in A. and Others v. the United Kingdom, cited above,  91, SIAC was set up in response to this Court’s judgment in Chahal, cited above.\n",
      "68.Under section 2(1) of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997, appeal to SIAC lies in respect of immigration decisions, including decisions to deport, when the Secretary of State’s decision is taken wholly or partly on grounds of national security or wholly or partly in reliance on information which in the Secretary of State’s opinion should not be made public in the interests of national security, the interests of the relationship between the United Kingdom and any other country, or otherwise in the public interest.\n",
      "69.As was also stated in A. and Others,  92, SIAC has a special procedure which enables it to consider not only material which can be made public (“open material”) but also other material which cannot (“closed material”). Neither the appellant nor his legal advisor can see the closed material. Accordingly, one or more security-cleared counsel, referred to as “special advocates”, are appointed by the Solicitor General to act on behalf of the appellant.\n",
      "Rule 4 of Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Procedure) Rules 2003 (“the 2003 Rules”) governs the use of closed material and states:\n",
      "“(1)When exercising its functions, the Commission shall secure that information is not disclosed contrary to the interests of national security, the international relations of the United Kingdom, the detection and prevention of crime, or in any other circumstances where disclosure is likely to harm the public interest.\n",
      "(2)Where these Rules require information not to be disclosed contrary to the public interest, that requirement is to be interpreted in accordance with paragraph (1).\n",
      "(3)Subject to paragraphs (1) and (2), the Commission must satisfy itself that the material available to it enables it properly to determine proceedings.”\n",
      "Rule 37(3)(c) directs that when serving closed material upon the special advocate, the Secretary of State must also serve a statement of the material in a form which can be served on the appellant, if and to the extent that it is possible to do so without disclosing information contrary to the public interest.\n",
      "70.Rule 38 provides that a special advocate may challenge the Secretary of State’s objections to disclosure of the closed material. SIAC may uphold or overrule the Secretary of State’s objection. If it overrules the objection, it may direct the Secretary of State to serve on the appellant all or part of the closed material which he has filed with the SIAC but not served on the appellant. In that event, the Secretary of State shall not be required to serve the material if he chooses not to rely upon it in the proceedings.\n",
      "71.A search is carried out for “exculpatory material”, that is, material that will advance the case of an appellant or detract from the case of the Secretary of State. Exculpatory material is disclosed to the appellant save where this would not be in the public interest. In that event it is disclosed to the special advocate.\n",
      "72.Section 7 of the 1997 Act confers a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against a final determination of an appeal made by SIAC in England and Wales “on any question of law material to that determination”.\n",
      "B.SIAC’s case law on assurances\n",
      "73.In addition to Jordan, the Government have negotiated memoranda of understanding on assurances with Ethiopia, Lebanon and Libya. They have negotiated a framework agreement for obtaining assurances from Algeria. SIAC has heard appeals from seventeen individuals whom the Government sought to deport on the basis of these assurances. SIAC has considered these appeals on a case-by-case basis but the general approach it has taken to assurances was set out in BB. v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department, SIAC determination of 5 December 2006,  5, where it found that, before assurances could remove a real risk of ill-treatment, four conditions had to be satisfied:\n",
      "(i)the terms of the assurances had be such that, if fulfilled, the person returned would not be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3;\n",
      "(ii)the assurances had been given in good faith;\n",
      "(iii)there had to be a sound objective basis for believing that the assurances would be fulfilled; and\n",
      "(iv) fulfilment of the assurances had to be capable of being verified.\n",
      "74.Applying that test, SIAC has found assurances to be sufficient for Algeria (see SIAC’s determinations in G (8 February 2007); Z and W(14May 2007) Y, BB and U (2 November 2007); PP (23 November 2007); B (30 July 2008); T (22 March 2010); Sihali (no. 2) (26 March 2010)). It also found them to be sufficient in respect of Ethiopia in the case of XX (10 September 2010). SIAC found assurances to be insufficient in respect of Libya, given the changeable nature of the then Gaddafi regime (DD and AS (27 April 2007)).\n"

However, those reports did not alter its conclusions in the present case that the MOU and Adaleh’s monitoring role provided sufficient protection.\n"

       "  10.the case involved an allegation of a conspiracy to carry out bombings in xxmaj jordan , which resulted in successful attacks on the xxmaj american xxmaj school and the xxmaj jerusalem xxmaj hotel in xxmaj amman in 1998 . xxmaj there were further convictions for offences of membership of a terrorist group , but these matters were the subject of a general amnesty . xxmaj the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the conclusion of the trial . \n",
       "  11.during the trial , one witness , xxmaj mohamed xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine , confessed that he and not the defendants had been involved in the bombings . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court hearing the case took the view that his confession was false , and demonstrably so , because of discrepancies between what he said about the nature of the explosives , for example , and other technical evidence . mral - xxmaj jeramaine was later executed for homicides for which he had been convicted in another trial . \n",
       "  12.the applicant maintains that the evidence against him was predominantly based upon an incriminating statement from a co - defendant , xxmaj abdul xxmaj nasser xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher ( also known as xxmaj al - xxmaj khamayseh ) . xxmaj in his confession to the xxmaj public ( or xxmaj state ) xxmaj prosecutor , xxmaj mr xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher alleged that the applicant had provided prior encouragement for the attacks . xxmaj he was also said to have congratulated the group after the attacks . \n",
       "  13.mr xxmaj al xxmaj hamasher , along with several other defendants , had complained during the proceedings before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court that they had been tortured by the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj general xxmaj intelligence xxmaj directorate ( “ the xxup gid ” ) , which shares responsibility for maintaining internal security and monitoring security threats in xxmaj jordan with the xxmaj public xxmaj security xxmaj directorate and the military . xxmaj at the end of the period of interrogation during which they claimed to have been tortured , the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor took a statement from each defendant . \n",
       "  14.at the trial there was evidence from lawyers and medical examiners and relatives of the defendants that there were visible signs of torture on the defendants . xxmaj however , the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court concluded that the defendants could not prove torture . \n",
       "  15.there were a number of appeals to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and remittals back to the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , although , as the applicant had been convicted in absentia , no appeals were taken on his behalf . xxmaj in the course of those appeals , the convictions were upheld on the basis that the relevant statements had been made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the confessions in those statements thus constituted sufficient evidence for conviction if the court accepted them and if the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was satisfied with the confessions . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected the claim that the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor had to prove that the defendants had confessed to him of their own accord : the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor ’s obligation to prove that a confession was obtained willingly only arose where the confession had not been obtained by him . xxmaj the confessions in question were authentic and there was no evidence that they had been made under financial or moral coercion . \n",
       "  16.the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation then considered the impact of the allegations that the confessions to the xxmaj state xxmaj prosecutor had resulted from coercion of the defendants and their families while they were in xxup gid detention . xxmaj such conduct during an investigation was against xxmaj jordanian law and rendered the perpetrators liable to punishment . xxmaj however , even assuming that the defendants’ allegations were true , that would not nullify the confessions made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor unless it were proved that those confessions were the consequence of illegal coercion to force the defendants to confess to things which they had not done . xxmaj the defendants had not shown that was the case . \n",
       "  17.as a result of the applicant ’s conviction in this trial , the xxmaj jordanian authorities requested the applicant ’s extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in early 2000 , the request was withdrawn by xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  2.the millennium conspiracy trial \n",
       "  18.in the autumn of 2000 the applicant was again tried in absentia in xxmaj jordan , this time in a case known as the “ millennium conspiracy ” , which concerned a conspiracy to cause explosions at western and xxmaj israeli targets in xxmaj jordan to coincide with the millennium celebrations . xxmaj the conspiracy was uncovered before the attacks could be carried out . xxmaj the applicant was alleged to have provided money for a computer and encouragement through his writings , which had been found at the house of a co - defendant , mrabuhawsher . xxmaj the applicant maintains that the main evidence against him was the testimony of xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher . \n",
       "  19.most of the defendants were convicted on most charges ; some were fully or partly acquitted . xxmaj the applicant was convicted and sentenced to 15years’ imprisonment with hard labour . xxmaj other defendants , including abuhawsher , were sentenced to death . xxmaj on appeal certain of the defendants , including , it appears , xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , claimed to have been tortured during 50days of interrogation when they were denied access to lawyers . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected this ground of appeal , holding that the minutes of interrogation showed that each defendant had been told of his right to remain silent about the charges unless their lawyer was present . xxmaj the applicant also states that the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation found that the alleged ill - treatment in xxup gid custody was irrelevant because the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court did not rely on the defendants’ confessions to the xxup gid but their confessions to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher remains under sentence of death . \n",
       "  20.the findings of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj special xxmaj immigration xxmaj appeals xxmaj commission ( xxup siac ) in respect of the evidence presented at each trial are set out at paragraph 45 below . xxmaj the further evidence which has become available since xxup siac ’s findings , and which has been submitted to this xxmaj court , is summarised as paragraphs 94–105 below . \n",
       "  c.the agreement of a memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  21.in xxmaj october 2001 , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office advised the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government that xxmaj article 3 of the xxmaj convention precluded the deportation of terrorist suspects to xxmaj jordan . xxmaj in xxmaj march 2003 , after a xxmaj government review of the possibility of removing such barriers to removal , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office confirmed that its advice of xxmaj october 2001 remained extant but that it was considering whether key countries would be willing and able to provide the appropriate assurances to guarantee that potential deportees would be treated in a manner consistent with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ’s obligations . xxmaj in xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj foreign xxmaj secretary agreed that seeking specific and credible assurances from foreign governments , in the form of memoranda of understanding , might be a way of enabling deportation from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  22.in xxmaj november 2003 , the xxmaj british xxmaj embassy in xxmaj amman was instructed to raise the idea of a framework memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) with the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj in xxmaj february 2005 , after meetings between the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan , and between the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj foreign xxmaj minister , agreement was reached on the principle of an xxup mou . \n",
       "  23.further negotiations took place in xxmaj june 2005 and an xxup mou was signed on 10 xxmaj august 2005 . xxmaj that xxup mou set out a series of assurances of compliance with international human rights standards , which would be adhered to when someone was returned to one xxmaj state from the other ( see paragraph 76 below ) . xxmaj the same day , a side letter from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj charg d’affaires , xxmaj amman , to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior was signed , which recorded the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government ’s ability to give assurances in individual cases that the death penalty would not be imposed . xxmaj in respect of the applicant , further questions as to the conduct of any retrial he would face after deportation were also put to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and answered in xxmaj may 2006 by the xxmaj legal xxmaj adviser at the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of xxmaj foreign xxmaj affairs . \n",
       "  24.the xxup mou also made provision for any person returned under it to contact and have prompt and regular visits from a representative of an independent body nominated jointly by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordanian xxmaj governments . xxmaj on 24 xxmaj october 2005 , the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre for xxmaj human xxmaj rights xxmaj studies ( “ the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ” ) signed a monitoring agreement with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government . xxmaj on 13 xxmaj february 2006 , the terms of reference for the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre were agreed ( see paragraph 80 below ) . \n",
       "  d.the applicant ’s appeal against deportation \n",
       "  25.on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , that is , the day after the xxup mou was signed , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with the notice of intention to deport . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state certified that the decision to deport the applicant was taken in the interests of national security . xxmaj the applicant appealed to xxup siac against that decision arguing , inter alia , that it was incompatible with xxmaj articles 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj relying on his previous asylum claim , he argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the xxmaj jordanian authorities . xxmaj if returned , he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would thus face lengthy pre - trial detention ( in breach of xxmaj article 5 ) and , if convicted , would face a long term of imprisonment . xxmaj all these factors meant he was at real risk of torture , either pre - trial or after conviction , to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons . xxmaj he was also at risk of the death penalty or rendition to other countries , such as the xxmaj united xxmaj states of xxmaj america . xxmaj relying on xxmaj article 6 , he alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair : the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , a military court , lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture – either of him , his co - defendants or other prisoners – would be admitted against him . \n",
       "  1.proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  ( a)the conduct of proceedings before xxup siac and its national security findings \n",
       "  26.the applicant ’s appeal was dismissed by xxup siac on 26 xxmaj february 2007 . xxmaj the appeal had been heard by xxup siac in two parts : an “ open session ” , where the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case and evidence was presented in the presence of the applicant and his representatives , and a “ closed session ” where parts of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case which could not be disclosed for security reasons were presented ( see paragraph 69 below ) . xxup siac heard evidence in closed session relating to the process by which the xxup mou had been agreed , the extent to which it would mitigate the risk of torture and also evidence as to the national security threat the applicant was alleged to have posed to the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ( “ closed material ” ) . xxmaj in the closed sessions , the applicant and his representatives were excluded but his interests were represented by special advocates . xxup siac then delivered an “ open judgment ” , which is publicly available , and a “ closed judgment ” , which was given only to the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state and the special advocates . \n",
       "  27.in reaching its decision as to whether the applicant ’s deportation was necessary in the interests of national security , xxup siac considered the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case to be “ well proved ” since the applicant was regarded by many terrorists as a spiritual adviser whose views legitimised acts of violence . xxmaj however , xxup siac did not take into account either of the applicant ’s xxmaj jordanian convictions in absentia , which were originally advanced as part of the xxmaj government ’s case . xxmaj the reason for this was that the xxmaj government had adopted what was described as a “ pragmatic approach ” in withdrawing reliance upon any evidence which it was alleged might have been obtained by torture on the grounds that it would require an investigation as to whether it was obtained by torture . xxmaj this was done in accordance the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords’ ruling in xxup a. and others ( no . 2 ) to that effect ( see paragraphs 136 and 137 below ) . \n",
       "  xxup 28.siac then reviewed the evidence it had heard from various sources including a senior xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom diplomat , xxmaj mr xxmaj mark xxmaj oakden , who gave evidence on the negotiation of the xxup mou , the monitoring agreement with the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre and on the risk faced by the applicant in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj on behalf of the applicant , it heard evidence on the xxmaj jordanian regime from three academics . xxmaj it also received evidence from an xxmaj arabic speaking barrister , msrana xxmaj refahi , who had travelled to xxmaj jordan to conduct research on the previous two trials including interviews with the defendants and their lawyers . xxmaj additionally , it considered evidence of the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government ’s interest in the applicant and allegations that a xxmaj jordanian national had been the subject of extraordinary rendition from xxmaj jordan to the xxmaj united xxmaj states . \n",
       "  ( b)siac ’s findings on the xxup mou \n",
       "  xxup 29.siac found that this xxmaj court ’s judgments in xxmaj chahal v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , 15 xxmaj november 1996 , xxmaj reports of xxmaj judgments and xxmaj decisions xxup 1996v and xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov v. xxmaj turkey [ xxup gc ] , nos . 46827 / 99 and 46951 / 99 , xxup echr xxup 2005i , showed that reliance could lawfully be placed on assurances ; but the weight to be given depended on the circumstances of each case . xxmaj there was a difference between relying on an assurance which required a xxmaj state to act in a way which would not accord with its normal law and an assurance which required a xxmaj state to adhere to what its law required but which might not be fully or regularly observed in practice . xxmaj referring to a decision of the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture , xxmaj agiza v. xxmaj sweden ( see paragraph 147 below ) , where the xxmaj swedish authorities had expelled an xxmaj egyptian national after receiving assurances from xxmaj egypt , xxup siac continued : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the case of xxmaj agiza stands as a clear warning of the dangers of simple reliance on a form of words and diplomatic monitoring . xxmaj there were already warning signs which ought to have alerted the xxmaj swedish authorities to the risks , including the role they had permitted to a foreign intelligence organisation . xxmaj but we note what to us are the crucial differences : the strength , duration and depth of the bilateral relationship between the two countries by comparison with any that has been pointed to between xxmaj sweden and xxmaj egypt ; the way in which the negotiations over the xxup mou have proceeded and the diplomatic assessment of their significance ; the particular circumstances of [ the present applicant ] and xxmaj jordan ; the degree of risk at the various stages , in the absence of the xxup mou , particularly at the early stages of detention which is when the risk from torture by the xxup gid would normally be at its greatest and when the confirmed torture of xxmaj agiza in xxmaj egypt appears to have occurred ; and the speed with which the monitors would be seeking and we believe obtaining access to the xxmaj appellant in those early days . xxmaj the xxmaj swedes felt that to seek to see xxmaj agiza would betray a want of confidence in the xxmaj egyptians , whereas there is no such feeling in either the xxup uk , the [ xxmaj adaleh ] xxmaj centre or the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj quite the reverse applies . xxmaj one aspect of that case which also troubled the [ xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture ] was that xxmaj agiza had been removed without final judicial determination of his case . xxmaj that would not be the position here . ” \n",
       "  30.in the present case , the political situation in xxmaj jordan and the freedom , albeit limited , of non - governmental organisations , the press and xxmaj parliament to express concerns would reduce the risks the applicant faced . xxmaj in addition , the level of scrutiny xxmaj jordan had accepted under the xxup mou could not but show that it was willing to abide by its terms and spirit . xxmaj each country had a real interest in preventing breaches of the xxup mou : the diplomatic relationship between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan was friendly and long - standing and of real value to xxmaj jordan and it would have a real incentive to avoid being seen as having broken its word . xxmaj both countries had an interest in maintaining co - operation on counter - terrorism matters . xxmaj the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom had a very real concern that it should be able to remove foreign nationals without breaching their rights under xxmaj article 3 , so failure in such a highly publicised case would be a major setback for that process . xxmaj that concern would thus act as a further incentive to investigate any breaches of the xxup mou . xxmaj while the xxup mou did not specify what steps would be taken in such an investigation , xxup siac accepted evidence from the xxmaj mr xxmaj oakden that any failure of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to respond to diplomatic queries would lead to “ rapidly escalating diplomatic and xxmaj ministerial contacts and reactions ” . \n",
       "  xxup 31.siac accepted that there were some weaknesses in the xxup mou and monitoring provisions . xxmaj some protections , such as prompt access to a lawyer , recorded interviews , independent medical examinations and prohibition on undisclosed places of detention , were not explicitly present but , in reality , most of these aspects were covered . xxmaj there was no guarantee that access to the applicant , as required by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s terms of reference , would always be granted but any refusal would be brought to light quite quickly ; in the early period of detention , the xxmaj centre was expected to visit the applicant three times a week . xxup siac also expected the xxup gid and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to react swiftly to any approach by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom were a visit to be refused . xxmaj it was “ disturbing ” that the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj special xxmaj rapporteur on xxmaj torture had been refused access to a xxup gid facility in xxmaj june 2006 , despite a prior arrangement that he would be permitted free access . xxmaj however , on the evidence it had heard , xxup siac found that there was no real risk of ill - treatment of the applicant by the xxup gid . xxmaj there was a weakness in the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s “ relative inexperience and scale ” ; it would be undertaking a task which would be new to it ; and it did not have the expertise among its staff , as it had recognised . xxmaj it was a fairly new body with limited resources and staff , although this could be overcome and the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government would bear the cost . xxmaj it was the very fact of monitoring visits which was important and the absence of specialist expertise was not fatal to their value . \n",
       "  ( c)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 3 \n",
       "  32.the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government did not contest the general thrust of the available material in relation to xxmaj jordan ’s human rights record and , in xxup siac ’s view , details of human rights violations in xxmaj jordan remained relevant to the assessment of the risk faced by the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj government also took the position that it could not return the applicant to xxmaj jordan , in conformity with its international obligations , in the absence of the particular measures contained in the xxup mou . xxmaj nevertheless , xxup siac found it important to consider the risks faced by the applicant by reference to the likely sequence of events if he were to be returned . xxmaj it found that the xxup mou might not be necessary for each risk but rather reinforce the protection available . \n",
       "  xxup 33.siac accepted that , on return , the applicant would be taken into the custody of the xxup gid and retried on the two charges for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would be accompanied by a representative of the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre to his place of detention and be medically examined . xxup siac also accepted that the xxup gid would interrogate the applicant with a view to obtaining a confession for use at trial and for more general intelligence purposes , though xxup siac found it to be speculative that xxup gid would interrogate the applicant about other offences in order to bring further charges against him ; there was no evidence of any other charges outstanding . xxup siac also accepted that the xxmaj united xxmaj states would seek to question the applicant and that this would take place soon after his arrival in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj however , there was no real risk that xxmaj article 3 would be breached before the conclusion of the retrial . \n",
       "  34.there was a real risk of torture or ill - treatment of an “ ordinary xxmaj islamist extremist ” in xxup gid detention before charge since such ill - treatment was widespread and longstanding and there was a climate of impunity and evasion of international monitoring in the xxup gid . xxmaj however , the applicant would be protected by his high profile , by the xxup mou and the monitoring agreement , especially since the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would be “ keen to prove its mettle ” and would itself be subject to the vigilance of other nongovernmental organisations . xxmaj this would also prevent any real risk of the use by the xxup gid of tactics such as last - minute refusals of access , claims that the applicant did not wish to see the monitors or moving him elsewhere without notification . xxmaj access by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would also prevent the applicant ’s incommunicado detention . \n",
       "  35.the xxup mou would also counteract the climate of impunity prevailing in the xxup gid and toleration of torture by its senior members . xxmaj the xxup mou and the monitoring arrangements were supported at the highest levels in xxmaj jordan – the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan ’s political power and prestige were behind the xxup mou – so it was reasonable to assume that instructions on how to treat the applicant had been given to the xxup gid and it would be aware that any breaches would not go unpunished . xxmaj moreover , senior members of the xxup gid had participated in the xxup mou negotiations and therefore would know the consequences of any failure to comply . xxmaj even if abuses were normally the work of rogue officers , the specific and unusual position of the applicant and the effect of the xxup mou would lead to senior officers preventing ill - treatment in his case , even if they did so only out of self - interest . \n",
       "  36.questioning by the xxmaj united xxmaj states was not forbidden by the xxup mou and , to xxup siac , it was probable that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj central xxmaj intelligence xxmaj agency would be allowed to question the applicant directly with the xxup gid present . xxmaj however , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would have made clear to the xxmaj united xxmaj states its interests in ensuring that the xxup mou was not breached . xxmaj the xxmaj jordanian authorities and xxmaj united xxmaj states would be careful to ensure that the xxmaj united xxmaj states did not “ overstep the mark ” . xxmaj assuming that the applicant remained in xxup gid custody and was not surrendered to the xxmaj united xxmaj states , there would be no real risk of ill - treatment at the pre - trial stage . xxmaj it was also highly unlikely that the applicant would be placed in any secret xxup gid or xxup cia detention facility in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  37.the same factors applied to any questioning which might take place soon after the conviction or acquittal of the applicant . xxmaj the xxup mou would continue to apply and it would be in the interests of both the xxmaj jordanians and the xxmaj americans to conduct any interrogation at the earliest opportunity rather than wait until after trial . xxmaj the applicant ’s high profile was also found to be “ unlikely to diminish much for some years ” . \n",
       "  38.there was little likelihood of the xxmaj jordanian authorities bringing any subsequent charges which carried the death penalty or seeking the death penalty in respect of the charges for which the applicant was to be retried . xxmaj instead , if he were convicted , the applicant would face a lengthy period of imprisonment . xxmaj there was a real risk of a life sentence in respect of the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge conspiracy , although there was a greater prospect that it would be considerably less because of the way in which sentences on the other defendants appeared to have been reduced on appeal , to 4 or 5 years . xxmaj there was no real risk of a life sentence in the millennium conspiracy retrial . xxmaj there was no rule that would prevent a higher sentence being imposed than the 15 year sentence that had been imposed in absentia . xxmaj however , the clear practice was against imposing higher sentences in retrials following initial convictions in absentia and there was no reason why a more unfavourable view would be taken of the applicant when he was present than when he was absent . xxmaj the applicant would serve any sentence in an ordinary prison and not a xxup gid detention facility ; the sentence of hard labour did not connote any additional punishment . xxmaj general conditions would not breach xxmaj article 3 and , although beatings sometimes occurred , there was no evidence that the applicant would be targeted as a political xxmaj islamist prisoner . xxmaj his status would again act to protect him . \n",
       "  39.in respect of rendition , there were “ powerful incentives ” for the xxmaj jordanian and xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj governments not to allow this to happen , not least the real domestic political difficulties this would create for the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and the unwillingness of the xxmaj united xxmaj states to destabilise the xxmaj jordanian regime . xxmaj any instances of alleged rendition from xxmaj jordan had involved people of other nationalities or , in one case , of a dual xxup us / xxmaj jordanian national . xxmaj it was also very unlikely that the applicant would be removed to a secret xxup cia facility in xxmaj jordan since this would require the connivance of the xxmaj jordanian authorities contrary to the xxup mou . xxmaj it was also unlikely that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government would seek the extradition of the applicant from xxmaj jordan when it had not sought his extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and there would be political difficulties for xxmaj jordan to accede to such a request . \n",
       "  ( d)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 5 \n",
       "  40.in relation to the applicant ’s detention following his removal to xxmaj jordan , xxup siac found that the time limits for notifying the legal authorities of an arrest ( 48 hours ) and for bringing formal charges ( 15 days ) were regularly and lawfully extended by the courts at the request of the prosecutor , in stages of up to 15 days to a maximum of 50 days . xxmaj it would therefore be compatible with xxmaj jordanian law for the applicant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a court before being charged . xxmaj such extensions were approved by a judicial authority , although not necessarily in the physical presence of the suspect . \n",
       "  xxup 41.siac noted that the xxup mou did not explicitly require that there be no extensions of time beyond the initial 15 day detention but required that a returned person be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorised by law to determine the lawfulness of his detention . xxmaj though “ promptly ” was not defined in the xxup mou , xxup siac found that this part of the xxup mou would be carried out , particularly since this was one of the earliest points at which the xxup mou would be engaged , and that the applicant ’s first appearance before a judicial authority would be within 48 hours . xxmaj it would not breach the xxup mou if the applicant were to be detained for a maximum of 50 days , by means of judicially approved 15 day extensions , or if he were absent when those later decisions were taken . xxmaj however , in reality the total period of 50 days was unlikely to be sought , even without the xxup mou , because the applicant faced a retrial and the case dossiers had already been through the trial and appeal process a number of times . \n",
       "  ( e)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 6 \n",
       "  42.it was common ground before xxup siac that the applicant ’s previous convictions would be set aside and he would face retrial before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court on the same charges . \n",
       "  43.in addition to his two challenges to the retrial process ( the impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the use of evidence obtained by torture ) the applicant also argued that he would be questioned in detention without the presence of a lawyer by the xxup gid , xxmaj united xxmaj states officials or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the latter had the power under xxmaj article 64(3 ) of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj criminal xxmaj trial xxmaj procedures xxmaj code to conduct an investigation in the absence of a lawyer “ whenever he [ deemed ] it necessary in order to reveal the truth ” . xxmaj this decision was not subject to review , though xxup siac also noted that a confession before the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was not admissible unless the individual had been warned that he need not answer questions without his lawyer present . xxup siac thought it unlikely that the applicant would have a lawyer present during questioning by the xxup gid or xxmaj united xxmaj states officials but very likely he would have access to a lawyer for any appearance before a judge or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj in terms of pre - trial preparation by the defence , the period and facilities available would be less extensive than in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom but nonetheless better than would normally be the case in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  44.with regard to the lack of independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , xxup siac found that the court would consist of three judges , at least two of whom would be legally qualified military officers with no security of tenure . xxmaj the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor would also be a military officer . xxmaj appeal would lie to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , a civilian court , though that court could not hear argument on any unfairness of the trial arising from the military composition of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . \n",
       "  45.as to the potential use of evidence obtained by torture in the applicant ’s retrial , xxup siac found as follows : \n",
       "  “ 418.the xxmaj jordanian legal system , by its terms , does not therefore permit the use of involuntary confession or incriminatory statements . xxmaj there is a judicial examination of allegations of that nature before the evidence is admitted . xxmaj those allegations can themselves be tested by evidence . xxmaj how far those allegations can be practicably tested is affected by certain features of the system . xxmaj the burden of proof for excluding confessions made to the xxmaj prosecutor lies on the defendant . xxmaj there is obvious difficulty in proving prior acts or threats by the xxup gid in the absence of systems for recording questioning , for ensuring the presence of lawyers during questioning , and independent prompt medical examinations . xxmaj there is likely to be considerable reluctance on the part of the xxmaj court to accept that confessions to the xxmaj prosecutor , a common source of evidence , are tainted by ill - treatment . xxmaj the xxmaj court or xxmaj prosecutor does not appear prepared to compel the appearance of xxup gid officials to testify about these allegations . xxmaj there may be a sense that these allegations are made routinely , as a matter of defence strategy . \n",
       "  419.there may well be a greater willingness to test the nature of confessions made only in the course of xxup gid questioning . xxmaj there is some evidence that at least at xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation level , confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture have been excluded , ( though it is not clear whether those were made to the xxup gid or to the xxmaj prosecutor ) . \n",
       "  420.however , the general background evidence and that specific to the two trials in question shows that there is at least a very real risk that the incriminating statements against the [ applicant ] were obtained as a result of treatment by the xxup gid which breached xxmaj article 3 xxup echr ; it may or may not have amounted to torture . xxmaj it is very improbable that those statements would be excluded on the retrial , because the ssct is unlikely to be persuaded that they were so obtained , particularly having already rejected that assertion at the first trials , although the makers could give evidence that they were so obtained and were in fact untrue . ” \n",
       "  xxmaj there was , therefore , a high probability that the past statements made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor which incriminated the applicant would be admitted . xxup siac further found that those statements would be of considerable , perhaps decisive , importance against him . xxmaj on this aspect of the retrial , xxup siac held : \n",
       "  “ 439.to us , the question comes back to whether or not it is unfair for the burden of proof in xxmaj jordan to lie where it does on this issue ; we do not think that to be unfair in itself . xxmaj however , this burden of proof appears to be unaccompanied by some of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment or means of assisting its proof eg video or other recording of questioning by the xxup gid , limited periods of detention for questioning , invariable presence of lawyers , routine medical examination , assistance from the xxmaj court in calling relevant officials or doctors . xxmaj the decisions are also made by a court which lacks independence and does not appear to examine closely or vigorously allegations of this nature . xxmaj it is taking these points in combination which leads us to conclude that the trial would be likely to be unfair within xxmaj article 6 because of the way the allegations about involuntary statements would be considered . ” \n",
       "  xxup 46.siac concluded that , despite its findings in respect of the independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 , there would be no flagrant denial of justice under xxmaj article 6 of the xxmaj convention if the applicant were retried in xxmaj jordan . xxup siac stated that the retrial would take place “ within a legally constructed framework covering the court system , the procedural rules and the offences ” , the applicant would be present and it would be in public . xxmaj the dossier from the original trial would be before the retrial court but the applicant could effectively challenge its contents . xxmaj the execution of xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine and the difficulty faced by other witnesses , notably xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , would not make the retrial unfair . xxup siac concluded : \n",
       "  “ 446.we accept the lack of institutional independence in the ssct . xxmaj the lack of independence for ssct xxmaj judges is in the structure and system . xxmaj there is no evidence as to why particular judges might be chosen for particular cases , or that they are ‘ leaned on’ . xxmaj but the ssct is not a mere tool of the executive : there is sound evidence that it appraises the evidence and tests it against the law , and acquits a number of defendants . xxmaj it has reduced sentences over time . \n",
       "  447.its judges have legal training and are career military lawyers . xxmaj there is a very limited basis beyond that for saying that they would be partial , and that has not been the gravamen of the complaint . xxmaj their background may well make them sceptical about allegations of abuse by the xxup gid affecting statements made to the xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj they may instinctively share the view that allegations of ill - treatment are a routine part of a defence case to excuse the incrimination of others . xxmaj the legal framework is poorly geared to detecting and acting upon allegations of abuse . xxmaj the way in which it approaches the admission of evidence , on the material we have , shows no careful scrutiny of potentially tainted evidence . xxmaj there would be considerable publicity given to the retrial and public trials can encourage greater care and impartiality in the examination of the evidence . xxmaj this would not be a mere show trial , nor were the first trials ; nor would the result be a foregone conclusion , regardless of the evidence . \n",
       "  448.reasons are given for the decisions , and an appeal to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation is available . xxmaj the fact that such an appeal can not cure the want of structural independence in the ssct is not a reason for discounting its existence in the overall assessment of whether there would be a complete denial of xxmaj article 6 rights . xxmaj this xxmaj court is a civilian court and the evidence of undue executive influence through appointment or removal is quite sparse . xxmaj there is no evidence again as to how its panels are chosen , nor that they are “ leaned on ” by the executive . xxmaj it plainly operates as a corrective to the rulings of the ssct on law and procedure , and is of some relevance to factual matters , even though it does not hear the evidence all over again or have a full factual jurisdiction except on xxmaj prosecutors’ appeals . xxmaj the probable sentences are not wholly disproportionate to the offences . \n",
       "  449.we have discussed at length the approach of the ssct to the admission of statements to a prosecutor allegedly given as a result of prior ill - treatment . xxmaj although we take the view that a contribution of factors would probably make the retrial unfair in that respect , they do not constitute a complete denial of a fair trial . xxmaj the existence of a legal prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence can not be ignored , nor the fact that the ssct would hear evidence relating to the allegations . xxmaj the role of the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation in reviewing and at times overturning the conclusions of the ssct on this issue is material . xxmaj the want of evidential or procedural safeguards to balance the burden of proof , and the probable cast of mind towards statements made to a prosecutor / judge in a civil law system , all within a security court dominated by military lawyers , does not suffice for a complete denial of justice . \n",
       "  450.there is a danger , given the inevitable focus on what is said to be potentially unfair about the retrial , in focussing exclusively on deficiencies when deciding whether there would be a total denial of the right to a fair trial , rather than looking at the picture of the trial as a whole . xxmaj that is what has to be done however and it is that picture as a whole which has led us to our conclusion on this issue . \n",
       "  451.the various factors which would be likely to cause the retrial to breach xxmaj article 6 are to a considerable degree interlinked . xxmaj taking them in the round does not persuade us that there is a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial . ” \n",
       "  47.finally , while there was the real prospect of a long term of imprisonment , this did not alter xxup siac ’s conclusion that the overall nature of the retrial would not be a total denial of the applicant ’s rights . \n",
       "  2.proceedings before the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal \n",
       "  48.the applicant appealed to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , which gave judgment on 9 xxmaj april 2008 , unanimously allowing the appeal in respect of xxmaj article 6 and the risk of the use of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 and dismissing it on all other grounds ( [ 2008 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 290 ) . \n",
       "  49.for the applicant ’s complaints under xxmaj article 3 as to the use of closed evidence by xxup siac and the reliance on the assurances in the xxup mou , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal considered it was bound by its previous ruling on these questions in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb ( xxmaj algeria ) , u ( xxmaj algeria ) v. the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department [ 2007 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 808 , which had found that : ( i ) xxup siac could consider closed evidence on safety on return ; and ( ii ) the relevance of assurances to safety on return was a matter of fact not law and thus it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on that ground . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also rejected the applicant ’s appeals based on xxmaj article 5 , finding that xxup siac was entitled to find as it did . \n",
       "  50.for xxmaj article 6 , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal rejected the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk of a “ flagrant denial of justice ” in his retrial in xxmaj jordan by reason of a lack of independence and or impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court : xxup siac had been entitled to find as it did on this point and this conclusion was not altered by the later decision of this xxmaj court in almoayad v. xxmaj germany ( dec . ) , no . 35865 / 03 , 20 xxmaj february 2007 . \n",
       "  51.however , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal accepted the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk that he would suffer a “ flagrant denial of justice ” by reason of the risk that statements obtained through treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 would be admitted as evidence against him in his retrial . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed : \n",
       "  “ xxup 45.siac understated or misunderstood the fundamental nature in xxmaj convention law of the prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by torture . xxmaj counsel for the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state said that it was no part of his submission to say that if it is clear that a trial will take place on the basis of evidence obtained under torture , whether of the individual themselves , or third parties , that that would not involve flagrant denial of justice . xxmaj accordingly , once xxup siac had found as a fact that there was a high probability that evidence that may very well have been obtained by torture ( xxup siac , 436 ) ; or in respect of which there was a very real risk that it had been obtained by torture or other conduct breaching article 3 ( xxup siac , 437 ) ; would be admitted at the trial of mrothman ; then xxup siac had to be satisfied that such evidence would be excluded or not acted on . xxmaj the grounds relied on by xxup siac for not finding a threatened breach of article 6 in that respect were insufficient . \n",
       "  46.we emphasise that that is not or not primarily a criticism of xxup siac ’s reasoning in terms of rationality , though we do consider additionally that xxup siac ’s conclusions did not follow rationally from its findings of fact . xxmaj rather , our principal finding is that xxup siac erred by applying an insufficiently demanding test to determine the issue of whether article 6 rights would be breached . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  48.the use of evidence obtained by torture is prohibited in xxmaj convention law not just because that will make the trial unfair , but also and more particularly because of the connexion of the issue with article 3 , a fundamental , unconditional and non - derogable prohibition that stands at the centre of the xxmaj convention protections . xxmaj as the ecthr put it in 105 of its judgment in xxmaj jalloh v xxmaj germany 44 xxup ehrr 32 : \n",
       "  ‘ incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture - should never be relied on as proof of the victim ’s guilt , irrespective of its probative value . xxmaj any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of xxmaj art.3 of the xxmaj convention sought to proscribe or , as it was so well put in the xxup us xxmaj supreme xxmaj court ’s judgment in the xxmaj rochin case 342 xxup us 165 , “ to afford brutality the cloak of law”.’ \n",
       "  xxmaj that view , that the use of evidence obtained by torture or ill - treatment is prohibited not just , or indeed primarily , because of its likely unreliability , but rather because the state must stand firm against the conduct that has produced the evidence , is universally recognised both within and outside xxmaj convention law . \n",
       "  xxmaj what is , with respect , a particularly strong statement to that effect , citing a multitude of equally strongly worded authorities , is to be found in 17 of the speech of xxmaj lord xxmaj bingham in a v xxmaj home xxmaj secretary ( xxmaj no2 ) [ 2006 ] 2 xxup ac 221 . \n",
       "  xxup 49.siac was wrong not to recognise this crucial difference between breaches of article 6 based on this ground and breaches of article 6 based simply on defects in the trial process or in the composition of the court . xxmaj rather , in its conclusions in 442452 of its determination ... it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the independence of the court : see in particular xxup siac at 449 - 450 . xxmaj that caused it not to recognise the high degree of assurance that is required in relation to proceedings in a foreign state before a person may lawfully be deported to face a trial that may involve evidence obtained by torture . ” \n",
       "  52.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal noted that xxup siac had reached its conclusion that there would not be a complete denial of justice in relation to the use of evidence obtained by torture by relying on the process , admittedly not wholly satisfactory , before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation . xxmaj for the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal that conclusion sat very ill with xxup siac ’s own findings about the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court process , in particular xxup siac ’s own concern as to the difficulties in proving that evidence had been obtained by torture . xxmaj in the opinion of the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , xxup siac ’s concern was “ amply justified by the litany of lack of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment ” in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj it also criticised xxup siac ’s “ disturbing failure ” to give proper weight to the findings as to the defects in the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj it was not open to xxup siac to conclude on that evidence that the risk of the total denial of justice that is represented by the use of evidence obtained by torture had been adequately excluded . xxup siac could not have so concluded if it had properly understood the status in xxmaj convention law of this aspect of article 6 . ” \n",
       "  3.proceedings before the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords \n",
       "  53.the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state appealed to the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords in relation to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal ’s conclusion on xxmaj article 6 . xxmaj the applicant cross - appealed in relation to his other xxmaj convention complaints . xxmaj the appeal was heard with the appeals of two of the appellants in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb and u ( see paragraph 48 above ) . xxmaj in the conjoined appeals the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords was therefore able to consider the use of closed material before xxup siac , the reliance on the assurances contained in the xxup mou and the applicant ’s xxmaj articles5 and 6 complaints . xxmaj the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords gave judgment on 18february 2009 unanimously allowing the xxmaj government ’s appeal and dismissing the applicant ’s cross - appeal ( [ 2009 ] xxup ukhl 10 ) . \n",
       "  ( a)article 3 : the “ closed ” proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  54.lord xxmaj phillips held that xxup siac was lawfully entitled to consider closed material in evaluating safety on return and there were cogent considerations of policy for doing so . a distinction had to be drawn between closed material on safety on return and the use of closed material in other proceedings , for example to establish the national security threat posed by an individual . xxmaj for the former , the individual would normally be aware of the nature of any risk on return and , in any event , it was for the individual himself , and not the xxmaj state , to make out his case on whether he would be at risk on return . xxmaj it was not likely to be critically important for a special advocate to be able to obtain input from the person to be deported in relation to closed evidence . xxmaj as regards the impracticality of obtaining an appropriate expert witness with security clearance to see the material , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips did not regard the problem as unfair . xxup siac ’s rules of procedure enabled the special advocate to ask xxup siac to call for more evidence and xxup siac , as an expert tribunal , could be relied upon “ to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate ’s submission ” . xxmaj in respect of the assurances , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips endorsed the view that the assurances contained in the xxup mou had to be disclosed but details of the negotiations leading to the xxup mou could be closed material . \n",
       "  55.lord xxmaj hoffmann rejected the applicant ’s argument on the more fundamental basis that he viewed this xxmaj court ’s case - law as making it clear that the determination whether a deportation order might infringe xxmaj article 3 did not require “ the full judicial panoply of article 6 or even 5(4 ) ” . xxmaj citing xxmaj chahal , cited above , he emphasised that all that was required was “ independent scrutiny of the claim ” , which had occurred in the applicant ’s case . \n",
       "  56.lord xxmaj hope agreed , albeit accepting that this xxmaj court had not yet had the opportunity to analyse whether the xxup siac system met the requirements of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj in his view , it did so . xxmaj lord xxmaj brown also agreed , emphasising that with regard to safety on return , no case was being made against the applicant ; rather it was he who was making a case against the returning xxmaj state . \n",
       "  ( b)article 3 : assurances and the xxup mou \n",
       "  57.lord xxmaj phillips ( with whom the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords agreed ) construed the this xxmaj court ’s case - law from xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , onwards as treating assurances “ as part of the matrix that had to be considered ” when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would face treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj he referred to the “ abundance ” of international law material , which supported the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by xxmaj state agents was endemic . xxmaj however , for xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips this came “ close to a ‘ xxmaj catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you can not rely on them ” . xxmaj in rejecting that proposition , he held that the only basis to interfere with the view of xxup siac was if its conclusions that the assurances could be relied upon were irrational and xxup siac ’s conclusions in the present case were not . \n",
       "  ( c)article 5 \n",
       "  58.the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords unanimously refused to interfere with the finding of fact by xxup siac that the applicant ’s exposure under xxmaj jordanian law to 50 days’ detention without access to a court or a lawyer , would not arise . xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found that , even if it would arise , 50 days’ detention would not constitute a flagrant breach of xxmaj article 5 . a flagrant breach was a breach whose consequences were so severe that they overrode the right of a xxmaj state to expel an alien from its territory . xxmaj that might be satisfied by arbitrary detention which lasted many years but not 50 days’ detention . \n",
       "  ( d)article 6 \n",
       "  59.on xxmaj article 6 , taking the test to be whether there would be a “ complete denial or nullification ” of the right to a fair trial , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips observed : \n",
       "  “ 136.this is neither an easy nor an adequate test of whether article 6 should bar the deportation of an alien . xxmaj in the first place it is not easy to postulate what amounts to ‘ a complete denial or nullification of the right to a fair trial’ . xxmaj that phrase can not require that every aspect of the trial process should be unfair . ... xxmaj what is required is that the deficiency or deficiencies in the trial process should be such as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of the prospective trial . \n",
       "  137.in the second place , the fact that the deportee may find himself subject in the receiving country to a legal process that is blatantly unfair can not , of itself , justify placing an embargo on his deportation . xxmaj the focus must be not simply on the unfairness of the trial process but on its potential consequences . xxmaj an unfair trial is likely to lead to the violation of substantive human rights and the extent of that prospective violation must plainly be an important factor in deciding whether deportation is precluded . ” \n",
       "  60.having reviewed , the relevant case - law of this xxmaj court , including xxmaj bader and xxmaj kanbor v. xxmaj sweden , no . 13284 / 04 , 42 , xxup echr xxup 2005xi , which he took to exemplify the need to consider the risk of a violation of xxmaj article 6 in combination with other xxmaj articles such as xxmaj articles 2 and 3 , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he xxmaj strasbourg jurisprudence , tentative though it is , has led me to these conclusions . xxmaj before the deportation of an alien will be capable of violating article 6 there must be substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk ( i ) that there will be a fundamental breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 and ( ii ) that this failure will lead to a miscarriage of justice that itself constitutes a flagrant violation of the victim ’s fundamental rights . ” \n",
       "  61.in the present case , the second limb was met by the potential sentences of imprisonment the applicant faced . xxmaj for the first limb , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips concluded that , although the military constitution of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court would render the trial contrary to xxmaj article 6 if it were held in a xxmaj convention xxmaj state , he agreed with xxup siac and the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , that it could not amount to a “ flagrant denial of justice ” sufficient to prevent deportation in a removal case . \n",
       "  62.in respect of the applicant ’s complaint that there was a real risk that the evidence against him had been obtained by torture , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips held that the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal erred . xxmaj it had required too high a degree of assurance that evidence that might have been obtained by torture would not be used in a foreign trial . xxmaj he stated : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he prohibition on receiving evidence obtained by torture is not primarily because such evidence is unreliable or because the reception of the evidence will make the trial unfair . xxmaj rather it is because ‘ the state must stand firm against the conduct that produced the evidence’ . xxmaj that principle applies to the state in which an attempt is made to adduce such evidence . xxmaj it does not require this state , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , to retain in this country to the detriment of national security a terrorist suspect unless it has a high degree of assurance that evidence obtained by torture will not be adduced against him in xxmaj jordan ... xxmaj the issue before xxup siac was whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that if xxmaj mr xxmaj othman were deported to xxmaj jordan the criminal trial that he would there face would have defects of such significance as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of his trial or , as xxup siac put it , to amount to a total denial of the right to a fair trial . xxup siac concluded that the deficiencies that xxup siac had identified did not meet that exacting test . i do not find that in reaching this conclusion xxup siac erred in law . ” \n",
       "  63.lord xxmaj hoffmann found that there was no xxmaj convention authority for the rule that , in the context of the application of xxmaj article 6 to a removal case , the risk of the use of evidence obtained by torture necessarily amounted to a flagrant denial of justice . \n",
       "  64.lord xxmaj hope agreed . xxmaj he accepted that this xxmaj court had adopted an “ uncompromising approach ” to the use at trial of evidence obtained by torture but the evidence before xxup siac did not come up to that standard . xxmaj there were allegations but no proof . xxmaj the assertion that there was a real risk that the evidence was obtained by torture was not enough to prohibit removal . xxmaj he recalled xxup siac ’s findings that the retrial would probably not comply with xxmaj article 6 if xxmaj jordan were a party to the xxmaj convention but would take place within a legally constructed framework . xxmaj there was sound evidence that the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , which was not a mere tool of the executive , appraised the evidence and tested it against the law . xxup siac had therefore been entitled to find as it did on the evidence . \n",
       "  65.lord xxmaj brown agreed with xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips and , referring to the majority of the xxmaj grand xxmaj chamber in xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , stated : “ if extradition was not unlawful even in the circumstances arising there , in my judgment expulsion most certainly is not unlawful here . ” \n",
       "  66.lord xxmaj mance , who agreed with the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords on xxmaj article 6 and all other points of appeal , noted a considerable resemblance between the concept of “ flagrant unfairness ” in this xxmaj court ’s case - law and the concept of denial of justice in public international law generally . xxmaj for the latter , the modern consensus was that the factual circumstances had to be egregious for xxmaj state responsibility to arise in international law . \n",

       "  xxmaj the reasons given by the judge included the following considerations : \n",
       "  \" a landlord 's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances , his living conditions and / or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future . \n",
       "  xxmaj in that connection , the following facts have already been established : that ' since his marriage , in xxmaj april 1979 , xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto has lived with his parents - in - law in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , [ xxmaj funchal ] ' ; that ' xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , one of xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's brothers and two of her aunts ... lived in the house ' ; that ' the plaintiffs ' house has three bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom ' ; that ' the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ' ; that ' xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents - in - law , who are at present the sole occupants , with xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , of the house in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' ; and that ' the plaintiffs both work in xxmaj funchal ' . \n",
       "  xxmaj it should be noted that xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need . xxmaj the plaintiffs ' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought , since they even have a bedroom for their son . \n",
       "  xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving , as the onus was on them to do , that the relations between themselves and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents were permanently strained and conflictual . xxmaj what is certain , however , is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son 's illness and their living conditions in that house . \n",
       "  xxmaj it might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with xxunk xxmaj barreto 's parents , ' who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' - that in view of the xxunk ' xxmaj when a man marries he needs a house ' , cited by xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto in his first application , the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there . \n",

       "  xxmaj however , each case is unique . xxmaj regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims , but not established , and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity , to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion , in the light of everyday experience , it can not be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there . \n",

       "  xxmaj each couple has a bedroom and the plaintiffs ' son has his . xxmaj and there is still one bedroom left over . \n",
       "  xxmaj the judgment must reflect the situation at the conclusion of the evidence and argument ( xxmaj article 663 para . 1 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation , the fact that they live with xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , albeit by their favour , is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by xxmaj article 1096 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ... xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house . \n",
       "  xxmaj derogation from the general principle and eviction of the tenant for the benefit of the landlord are possible only where it appears to be absolutely necessary , for weighty reasons , for the landlord to live in the property ( xxmaj article 1095 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ) . \n",

       "  xxmaj all of the servicemen who were in xxmaj braşov city centre that night , the vast majority of whom gave evidence , stated that they were tired , as the majority had been posted there since the previous night , namely 21 to 22 xxmaj december 1989 , that they were all afraid , because they had learned what was happening in xxmaj bucharest and that , on their own initiative , they had loaded their weapons , since they were expecting to be attacked from one moment to the next . \n",
       "  xxmaj in those circumstances , it had been sufficient that civilian xxup i.e. fire the first shots in the direction of persons whom he considered suspect for all of the servicemen in the city centre to open fire in turn , without prior orders from their commanders ... \n",
       "  xxmaj all of the armed individuals – both servicemen and civilians – who used their weapons in the city centre during the night of 22 to 23 xxmaj december 1989 were acting in good faith and were attached to the revolution , and were convinced that they were acting to protect it . xxmaj they used their weapons on account of the prevailing confusion and the considerable fear and suspicion which had taken hold of everyone who was in the streets . ” \n",

       "  “ xxmaj in support of her application for the annulment of the decision to give up the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 and for the child ’s return , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk alleges that an error was committed as to the meaning and scope of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 . \n",

       "  xxmaj the exercise by any woman of this right , which is enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , is governed by the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 222 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code , as amended by the xxmaj act of 22 xxmaj january 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj it appears from the evidence before the court ... that at least two lengthy interviews were held in order to explain to this woman the conditions and effects of anonymous registration of a birth . xxmaj these interviews took place in the presence of xxmaj english speakers , and xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , who chose to come to xxmaj france to give birth , can not expect the social services to have offered anything more in this respect , particularly not the presence of an official interpreter , which is not provided for or required by any statutory instrument . xxmaj furthermore , it appears from the proceedings ... and from the written submissions summarising her counsel ’s address ... that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was taken to hospital by a lawyer ; she had therefore clearly sought legal advice prior to the birth . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , no matter what psychological state the applicant may have been in , like any woman opting to give birth in these circumstances , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was nevertheless fully aware of both the immediate and the future implications of her actions and decisions . xxmaj she thus acted quite consciously in having the birth registered anonymously and giving the child up to the social services to be taken into xxmaj state care , and there are no grounds for arguing that her intellectual faculties were impaired or that the consent was invalid in any way ; moreover , the question of consent is not applicable from a civil - status perspective . \n",
       "  xxmaj in addition , as regards the formal propriety of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , once a child is entrusted to the social services , the latter assume a number of obligations , including the provision of information ... xxmaj it appears from the record of the child ’s placement , which contains entries whose existence is not disputed , that the social services fulfilled their obligation to provide information on a child ’s placement in xxmaj state care and the ensuing legal effects . xxmaj such information was , moreover , provided in xxmaj english , and the notice and model letter requesting the return of the child were indeed given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk fully understood the meaning and scope of this information since she left documents for the child in the event that the latter expressed the wish to discover her origins at a future date . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk clearly expressed her wish that the child should never be able to have legal ties to her . xxmaj moreover , she did not withdraw her consent within the two - month period . xxmaj it should be noted in this connection that this right is strictly personal ; accordingly , no action by a third person may be treated as an action to withdraw consent , that being the sole prerogative of the mother , or interrupt the relevant period . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , there are no grounds for declaring null and void the record of 19february 2002 , which served as an entirely valid basis for the placement in xxmaj state care ( first provisionally and later with final effect ) of the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 with no established parentage ... \n",
       "  xxmaj since the mother did not apply for the return of the child within two months after giving her up , the child , who has no legally established parentage , was able to be placed with foster parents by the xxmaj state authorities with a view to her adoption under xxmaj article 351 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj such placement for adoption , by virtue of the provisions of xxmaj article 352 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , constitutes a bar not only to the return of the child to the mother but also to any declaration of filiation or recognition . xxmaj the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared ineffective . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk further alleges a violation of xxmaj articles 13 and 14 of the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights . \n",
       "  xxmaj as stated above , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk gave birth ... while wishing to keep the birth and her identity secret , a right enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and given effect by the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj more generally , these xxmaj articles govern the conditions for giving up a child , for consent to adoption or for anonymous registration of a birth , as well as the conditions and procedures applicable in the event of repudiation and / or withdrawal of any of these measures . \n",
       "  xxmaj they strike a delicate balance between the rights of a mother , which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , to give birth anonymously with the consequences that entails , and the rights of the foster parents and of the child , whose rights are now framed in such a way as to allow him or her access to more information , if he or she so desires , but in whose interests stability and certainty , both psychological and legal , must be sought , if only through the shortness of the time within which the natural parents may avail themselves of the appropriate procedures . \n",
       "  xxmaj the instant case thus can not be said to involve any discrimination or deprivation of the enjoyment of a right secured to the mother or the child by the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights , or indeed our national law , within the meaning of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj similarly , no matter how short they are , time - limits do exist in xxmaj french law for bringing an action in the ordinary courts , constituting , within the meaning of xxmaj article 13 of the xxmaj convention ... , an effective remedy before a national authority independent of the administrative authority that may be required to rule on an application for the return of a child or to approve an adoption . ” \n",
       "  22.the applicant appealed . xxmaj in a judgment of 22 xxmaj september 2003 the xxmaj douai xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal set aside the first - instance judgment . xxmaj after reiterating the content of the record of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , and in particular the information it provided , the court held : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj paragraph 3 of the section on information thus expressly mentions the existence of two time - limits for the child ’s return without any further formalities , one being two months ( the only possible limit that could apply in the instant case ) , the other being six months , where the second parent has not entrusted the child to the social services . \n",
       "  xxmaj this six - month time - limit is mentioned on two further occasions , firstly in relation to the right to have the child returned to the second parent and secondly in indicating that even after the expiry of the two - month and six - month periods , a court action may still be brought . \n",
       "  xxmaj this information could have misled xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... since in reality the six - month time - limit applicable under xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code in the circumstances referred to in xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 did not apply in the instant case , there being no established paternity as the mother had registered the birth anonymously , and the placement therefore came under point ( 1 ) of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national who is a native xxmaj english speaker and does not speak xxmaj french , could not have known the consequences in xxmaj french law of anonymous registration of the birth , in terms of her rights and those of the biological father , and the information given was in no way capable of xxunk her in a clear and precise manner . \n",
       "  xxmaj having been informed of the existence of a six - month time - limit where ‘ the child has a second parent who did not entrust him or her to the service’ , she may legitimately have thought , in the light of the information set out in the record , that this time - limit was applicable in her case since she had on several occasions notified the local health and social services department of the existence of a biological father who had not been informed of the placement procedure . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will be observed that there is no mention in the record that an interpreter was present when it was signed and that it has not been disputed that a member of the maternity ward staff assisted with the translation and the explanation in xxmaj english of the information given in xxmaj french to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... xxmaj however , a translation of this nature , which was provided by a person who used xxmaj english only occasionally and did not have specific legal knowledge , and which , moreover , was based on particularly ambiguous information as to the time - limits , did not enable xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... to have access to proper information about her rights regarding the procedures for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj it therefore appears that the information provided to the appellant concerning the right to have the child returned was inaccurate or at least particularly ambiguous , and was set out in a pre - printed document not specially adapted to the procedure of anonymous birth registration but designed for use in any of the circumstances covered by xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code for the taking of a child into xxmaj state care ; that reference was made to a six - month time - limit not applicable in her case ; and that , moreover , being an native xxmaj english speaker , the mother was not effectively informed of the procedures for the return of her child and of the strict two - month time - limit that applied in her case . \n",
       "  xxmaj furthermore , it has not been shown in any way that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... otherwise received any clear information before the record was signed as to her right to recover the child . \n",
       "  xxmaj the note by xxmaj ms xxup f. – who also drew up the record in issue – besides having no evidential value , since it was written by a party to the proceedings , does not contain any clarification as to the information given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... about the time - limit for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , the fact that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... was in contact with a xxmaj french lawyer prior to the birth does not mean that she received precise information from him about the exclusive nature of the two - month time - limit ... \n",

       "  8.the applicant was convicted on 21 xxmaj february 2007 , at the age of twenty , of two counts of possession of xxmaj class a drugs with intent to supply . xxmaj he pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in 2005 , in which the applicant had been shot . xxmaj he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment , and on 18october 2007 was notified of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s intention to deport him . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom since the age of three . xxmaj his aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at the age of five , and the first official record of his presence was when he was eight years old . xxmaj even allowing for his long stay in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , only four years had been with valid leave . xxmaj it was believed that he was in contact with his mother , who remained in xxmaj nigeria , and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority , the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances . xxmaj it was not accepted that he had family life in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",

       "  21.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test . xxmaj it required firstly , that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity . xxmaj secondly , there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj the court also found , thirdly , that because of the “ foreign ” nature of expulsion cases , the threshold for what would meet the threshold of xxmaj article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving xxmaj state but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness . xxmaj fourthly , a risk of suicide could , in principle , form the basis of a successful claim under xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj fifthly , an important factor in determining whether removal would breach xxmaj article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill - treatment in the receiving xxmaj state , if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide , was objectively well - founded . a fear found not to be objectively well - founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj finally , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and / or receiving xxmaj states had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide . xxmaj the existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of xxmaj article 3 as a result of removal . \n",
       "  22.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages , namely , in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , in transit , and in the receiving xxmaj state . xxmaj the threshold for xxmaj article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving xxmaj state was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in the case of the particular appellant , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal found that the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities ; that the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state would provide appropriately qualified xxunk and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport ; and that in light of the finding that the applicant ’s fears of return to xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka were not objectively well - founded , and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that xxmaj state , the risk of suicide in xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka would not reach the very high threshold of xxmaj article 3 . \n",

       "  xxmaj the court further considered that despite those procedural shortcomings the decision under appeal had , in any event , been lawful . xxmaj the court noted that the crux of that part of the case was to assess whether the applicants could , under the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act of 1985 , claim to have a right to perpetual use of the plots concerned conferred on them by way of compensation for the expropriation carried out under the 1945 decree . \n",
       "  xxmaj the court observed that under section xxunk ) of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act , a right to perpetual use of land could only be conferred in cases where real property was given back to its former owners . xxmaj however , that entitlement had been limited to certain categories of real property , namely one - family houses or small apartment blocks . xxmaj the property concerned in the present case did not belong to any of those categories . xxmaj moreover , the 1985 xxmaj act had laid down a time - limit for the submission of such claims , and that limit had expired on 31 xxmaj december 1988 . xxmaj the applicants’ application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 to have their former property restored to them and for the right to perpetual use of the property had been lodged outside that time - limit . xxmaj accordingly , the restitution could not have been ordered . xxmaj the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court therefore dismissed the remainder of the applicants’ appeal . \n",

       "  9.in xxmaj april 1999 , the applicant was convicted in absentia in xxmaj jordan of conspiracy to cause explosions , in a trial known as the “ reform and challenge ” case . xxmaj he was the twelfth of thirteen defendants . \n",
       "  10.the case involved an allegation of a conspiracy to carry out bombings in xxmaj jordan , which resulted in successful attacks on the xxmaj american xxmaj school and the xxmaj jerusalem xxmaj hotel in xxmaj amman in 1998 . xxmaj there were further convictions for offences of membership of a terrorist group , but these matters were the subject of a general amnesty . xxmaj the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the conclusion of the trial . \n",
       "  11.during the trial , one witness , xxmaj mohamed xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine , confessed that he and not the defendants had been involved in the bombings . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court hearing the case took the view that his confession was false , and demonstrably so , because of discrepancies between what he said about the nature of the explosives , for example , and other technical evidence . mral - xxmaj jeramaine was later executed for homicides for which he had been convicted in another trial . \n",
       "  12.the applicant maintains that the evidence against him was predominantly based upon an incriminating statement from a co - defendant , xxmaj abdul xxmaj nasser xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher ( also known as xxmaj al - xxmaj khamayseh ) . xxmaj in his confession to the xxmaj public ( or xxmaj state ) xxmaj prosecutor , xxmaj mr xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher alleged that the applicant had provided prior encouragement for the attacks . xxmaj he was also said to have congratulated the group after the attacks . \n",
       "  13.mr xxmaj al xxmaj hamasher , along with several other defendants , had complained during the proceedings before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court that they had been tortured by the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj general xxmaj intelligence xxmaj directorate ( “ the xxup gid ” ) , which shares responsibility for maintaining internal security and monitoring security threats in xxmaj jordan with the xxmaj public xxmaj security xxmaj directorate and the military . xxmaj at the end of the period of interrogation during which they claimed to have been tortured , the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor took a statement from each defendant . \n",
       "  14.at the trial there was evidence from lawyers and medical examiners and relatives of the defendants that there were visible signs of torture on the defendants . xxmaj however , the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court concluded that the defendants could not prove torture . \n",
       "  15.there were a number of appeals to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and remittals back to the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , although , as the applicant had been convicted in absentia , no appeals were taken on his behalf . xxmaj in the course of those appeals , the convictions were upheld on the basis that the relevant statements had been made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the confessions in those statements thus constituted sufficient evidence for conviction if the court accepted them and if the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was satisfied with the confessions . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected the claim that the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor had to prove that the defendants had confessed to him of their own accord : the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor ’s obligation to prove that a confession was obtained willingly only arose where the confession had not been obtained by him . xxmaj the confessions in question were authentic and there was no evidence that they had been made under financial or moral coercion . \n",
       "  16.the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation then considered the impact of the allegations that the confessions to the xxmaj state xxmaj prosecutor had resulted from coercion of the defendants and their families while they were in xxup gid detention . xxmaj such conduct during an investigation was against xxmaj jordanian law and rendered the perpetrators liable to punishment . xxmaj however , even assuming that the defendants’ allegations were true , that would not nullify the confessions made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor unless it were proved that those confessions were the consequence of illegal coercion to force the defendants to confess to things which they had not done . xxmaj the defendants had not shown that was the case . \n",
       "  17.as a result of the applicant ’s conviction in this trial , the xxmaj jordanian authorities requested the applicant ’s extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in early 2000 , the request was withdrawn by xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  2.the millennium conspiracy trial \n",
       "  18.in the autumn of 2000 the applicant was again tried in absentia in xxmaj jordan , this time in a case known as the “ millennium conspiracy ” , which concerned a conspiracy to cause explosions at western and xxmaj israeli targets in xxmaj jordan to coincide with the millennium celebrations . xxmaj the conspiracy was uncovered before the attacks could be carried out . xxmaj the applicant was alleged to have provided money for a computer and encouragement through his writings , which had been found at the house of a co - defendant , mrabuhawsher . xxmaj the applicant maintains that the main evidence against him was the testimony of xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher . \n",
       "  19.most of the defendants were convicted on most charges ; some were fully or partly acquitted . xxmaj the applicant was convicted and sentenced to 15years’ imprisonment with hard labour . xxmaj other defendants , including abuhawsher , were sentenced to death . xxmaj on appeal certain of the defendants , including , it appears , xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , claimed to have been tortured during 50days of interrogation when they were denied access to lawyers . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected this ground of appeal , holding that the minutes of interrogation showed that each defendant had been told of his right to remain silent about the charges unless their lawyer was present . xxmaj the applicant also states that the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation found that the alleged ill - treatment in xxup gid custody was irrelevant because the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court did not rely on the defendants’ confessions to the xxup gid but their confessions to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher remains under sentence of death . \n",
       "  20.the findings of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj special xxmaj immigration xxmaj appeals xxmaj commission ( xxup siac ) in respect of the evidence presented at each trial are set out at paragraph 45 below . xxmaj the further evidence which has become available since xxup siac ’s findings , and which has been submitted to this xxmaj court , is summarised as paragraphs 94–105 below . \n",
       "  c.the agreement of a memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  21.in xxmaj october 2001 , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office advised the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government that xxmaj article 3 of the xxmaj convention precluded the deportation of terrorist suspects to xxmaj jordan . xxmaj in xxmaj march 2003 , after a xxmaj government review of the possibility of removing such barriers to removal , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office confirmed that its advice of xxmaj october 2001 remained extant but that it was considering whether key countries would be willing and able to provide the appropriate assurances to guarantee that potential deportees would be treated in a manner consistent with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ’s obligations . xxmaj in xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj foreign xxmaj secretary agreed that seeking specific and credible assurances from foreign governments , in the form of memoranda of understanding , might be a way of enabling deportation from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  22.in xxmaj november 2003 , the xxmaj british xxmaj embassy in xxmaj amman was instructed to raise the idea of a framework memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) with the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj in xxmaj february 2005 , after meetings between the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan , and between the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj foreign xxmaj minister , agreement was reached on the principle of an xxup mou . \n",
       "  23.further negotiations took place in xxmaj june 2005 and an xxup mou was signed on 10 xxmaj august 2005 . xxmaj that xxup mou set out a series of assurances of compliance with international human rights standards , which would be adhered to when someone was returned to one xxmaj state from the other ( see paragraph 76 below ) . xxmaj the same day , a side letter from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj charg d’affaires , xxmaj amman , to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior was signed , which recorded the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government ’s ability to give assurances in individual cases that the death penalty would not be imposed . xxmaj in respect of the applicant , further questions as to the conduct of any retrial he would face after deportation were also put to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and answered in xxmaj may 2006 by the xxmaj legal xxmaj adviser at the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of xxmaj foreign xxmaj affairs . \n",
       "  24.the xxup mou also made provision for any person returned under it to contact and have prompt and regular visits from a representative of an independent body nominated jointly by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordanian xxmaj governments . xxmaj on 24 xxmaj october 2005 , the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre for xxmaj human xxmaj rights xxmaj studies ( “ the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ” ) signed a monitoring agreement with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government . xxmaj on 13 xxmaj february 2006 , the terms of reference for the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre were agreed ( see paragraph 80 below ) . \n",
       "  d.the applicant ’s appeal against deportation \n",
       "  25.on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , that is , the day after the xxup mou was signed , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with the notice of intention to deport . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state certified that the decision to deport the applicant was taken in the interests of national security . xxmaj the applicant appealed to xxup siac against that decision arguing , inter alia , that it was incompatible with xxmaj articles 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj relying on his previous asylum claim , he argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the xxmaj jordanian authorities . xxmaj if returned , he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would thus face lengthy pre - trial detention ( in breach of xxmaj article 5 ) and , if convicted , would face a long term of imprisonment . xxmaj all these factors meant he was at real risk of torture , either pre - trial or after conviction , to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons . xxmaj he was also at risk of the death penalty or rendition to other countries , such as the xxmaj united xxmaj states of xxmaj america . xxmaj relying on xxmaj article 6 , he alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair : the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , a military court , lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture – either of him , his co - defendants or other prisoners – would be admitted against him . \n",
       "  1.proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  ( a)the conduct of proceedings before xxup siac and its national security findings \n",
       "  26.the applicant ’s appeal was dismissed by xxup siac on 26 xxmaj february 2007 . xxmaj the appeal had been heard by xxup siac in two parts : an “ open session ” , where the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case and evidence was presented in the presence of the applicant and his representatives , and a “ closed session ” where parts of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case which could not be disclosed for security reasons were presented ( see paragraph 69 below ) . xxup siac heard evidence in closed session relating to the process by which the xxup mou had been agreed , the extent to which it would mitigate the risk of torture and also evidence as to the national security threat the applicant was alleged to have posed to the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ( “ closed material ” ) . xxmaj in the closed sessions , the applicant and his representatives were excluded but his interests were represented by special advocates . xxup siac then delivered an “ open judgment ” , which is publicly available , and a “ closed judgment ” , which was given only to the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state and the special advocates . \n",
       "  27.in reaching its decision as to whether the applicant ’s deportation was necessary in the interests of national security , xxup siac considered the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case to be “ well proved ” since the applicant was regarded by many terrorists as a spiritual adviser whose views legitimised acts of violence . xxmaj however , xxup siac did not take into account either of the applicant ’s xxmaj jordanian convictions in absentia , which were originally advanced as part of the xxmaj government ’s case . xxmaj the reason for this was that the xxmaj government had adopted what was described as a “ pragmatic approach ” in withdrawing reliance upon any evidence which it was alleged might have been obtained by torture on the grounds that it would require an investigation as to whether it was obtained by torture . xxmaj this was done in accordance the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords’ ruling in xxup a. and others ( no . 2 ) to that effect ( see paragraphs 136 and 137 below ) . \n",
       "  xxup 28.siac then reviewed the evidence it had heard from various sources including a senior xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom diplomat , xxmaj mr xxmaj mark xxmaj oakden , who gave evidence on the negotiation of the xxup mou , the monitoring agreement with the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre and on the risk faced by the applicant in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj on behalf of the applicant , it heard evidence on the xxmaj jordanian regime from three academics . xxmaj it also received evidence from an xxmaj arabic speaking barrister , msrana xxmaj refahi , who had travelled to xxmaj jordan to conduct research on the previous two trials including interviews with the defendants and their lawyers . xxmaj additionally , it considered evidence of the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government ’s interest in the applicant and allegations that a xxmaj jordanian national had been the subject of extraordinary rendition from xxmaj jordan to the xxmaj united xxmaj states . \n",
       "  ( b)siac ’s findings on the xxup mou \n",
       "  xxup 29.siac found that this xxmaj court ’s judgments in xxmaj chahal v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , 15 xxmaj november 1996 , xxmaj reports of xxmaj judgments and xxmaj decisions xxup 1996v and xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov v. xxmaj turkey [ xxup gc ] , nos . 46827 / 99 and 46951 / 99 , xxup echr xxup 2005i , showed that reliance could lawfully be placed on assurances ; but the weight to be given depended on the circumstances of each case . xxmaj there was a difference between relying on an assurance which required a xxmaj state to act in a way which would not accord with its normal law and an assurance which required a xxmaj state to adhere to what its law required but which might not be fully or regularly observed in practice . xxmaj referring to a decision of the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture , xxmaj agiza v. xxmaj sweden ( see paragraph 147 below ) , where the xxmaj swedish authorities had expelled an xxmaj egyptian national after receiving assurances from xxmaj egypt , xxup siac continued : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the case of xxmaj agiza stands as a clear warning of the dangers of simple reliance on a form of words and diplomatic monitoring . xxmaj there were already warning signs which ought to have alerted the xxmaj swedish authorities to the risks , including the role they had permitted to a foreign intelligence organisation . xxmaj but we note what to us are the crucial differences : the strength , duration and depth of the bilateral relationship between the two countries by comparison with any that has been pointed to between xxmaj sweden and xxmaj egypt ; the way in which the negotiations over the xxup mou have proceeded and the diplomatic assessment of their significance ; the particular circumstances of [ the present applicant ] and xxmaj jordan ; the degree of risk at the various stages , in the absence of the xxup mou , particularly at the early stages of detention which is when the risk from torture by the xxup gid would normally be at its greatest and when the confirmed torture of xxmaj agiza in xxmaj egypt appears to have occurred ; and the speed with which the monitors would be seeking and we believe obtaining access to the xxmaj appellant in those early days . xxmaj the xxmaj swedes felt that to seek to see xxmaj agiza would betray a want of confidence in the xxmaj egyptians , whereas there is no such feeling in either the xxup uk , the [ xxmaj adaleh ] xxmaj centre or the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj quite the reverse applies . xxmaj one aspect of that case which also troubled the [ xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture ] was that xxmaj agiza had been removed without final judicial determination of his case . xxmaj that would not be the position here . ” \n",
       "  30.in the present case , the political situation in xxmaj jordan and the freedom , albeit limited , of non - governmental organisations , the press and xxmaj parliament to express concerns would reduce the risks the applicant faced . xxmaj in addition , the level of scrutiny xxmaj jordan had accepted under the xxup mou could not but show that it was willing to abide by its terms and spirit . xxmaj each country had a real interest in preventing breaches of the xxup mou : the diplomatic relationship between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan was friendly and long - standing and of real value to xxmaj jordan and it would have a real incentive to avoid being seen as having broken its word . xxmaj both countries had an interest in maintaining co - operation on counter - terrorism matters . xxmaj the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom had a very real concern that it should be able to remove foreign nationals without breaching their rights under xxmaj article 3 , so failure in such a highly publicised case would be a major setback for that process . xxmaj that concern would thus act as a further incentive to investigate any breaches of the xxup mou . xxmaj while the xxup mou did not specify what steps would be taken in such an investigation , xxup siac accepted evidence from the xxmaj mr xxmaj oakden that any failure of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to respond to diplomatic queries would lead to “ rapidly escalating diplomatic and xxmaj ministerial contacts and reactions ” . \n",
       "  xxup 31.siac accepted that there were some weaknesses in the xxup mou and monitoring provisions . xxmaj some protections , such as prompt access to a lawyer , recorded interviews , independent medical examinations and prohibition on undisclosed places of detention , were not explicitly present but , in reality , most of these aspects were covered . xxmaj there was no guarantee that access to the applicant , as required by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s terms of reference , would always be granted but any refusal would be brought to light quite quickly ; in the early period of detention , the xxmaj centre was expected to visit the applicant three times a week . xxup siac also expected the xxup gid and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to react swiftly to any approach by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom were a visit to be refused . xxmaj it was “ disturbing ” that the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj special xxmaj rapporteur on xxmaj torture had been refused access to a xxup gid facility in xxmaj june 2006 , despite a prior arrangement that he would be permitted free access . xxmaj however , on the evidence it had heard , xxup siac found that there was no real risk of ill - treatment of the applicant by the xxup gid . xxmaj there was a weakness in the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s “ relative inexperience and scale ” ; it would be undertaking a task which would be new to it ; and it did not have the expertise among its staff , as it had recognised . xxmaj it was a fairly new body with limited resources and staff , although this could be overcome and the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government would bear the cost . xxmaj it was the very fact of monitoring visits which was important and the absence of specialist expertise was not fatal to their value . \n",
       "  ( c)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 3 \n",
       "  32.the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government did not contest the general thrust of the available material in relation to xxmaj jordan ’s human rights record and , in xxup siac ’s view , details of human rights violations in xxmaj jordan remained relevant to the assessment of the risk faced by the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj government also took the position that it could not return the applicant to xxmaj jordan , in conformity with its international obligations , in the absence of the particular measures contained in the xxup mou . xxmaj nevertheless , xxup siac found it important to consider the risks faced by the applicant by reference to the likely sequence of events if he were to be returned . xxmaj it found that the xxup mou might not be necessary for each risk but rather reinforce the protection available . \n",
       "  xxup 33.siac accepted that , on return , the applicant would be taken into the custody of the xxup gid and retried on the two charges for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would be accompanied by a representative of the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre to his place of detention and be medically examined . xxup siac also accepted that the xxup gid would interrogate the applicant with a view to obtaining a confession for use at trial and for more general intelligence purposes , though xxup siac found it to be speculative that xxup gid would interrogate the applicant about other offences in order to bring further charges against him ; there was no evidence of any other charges outstanding . xxup siac also accepted that the xxmaj united xxmaj states would seek to question the applicant and that this would take place soon after his arrival in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj however , there was no real risk that xxmaj article 3 would be breached before the conclusion of the retrial . \n",
       "  34.there was a real risk of torture or ill - treatment of an “ ordinary xxmaj islamist extremist ” in xxup gid detention before charge since such ill - treatment was widespread and longstanding and there was a climate of impunity and evasion of international monitoring in the xxup gid . xxmaj however , the applicant would be protected by his high profile , by the xxup mou and the monitoring agreement , especially since the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would be “ keen to prove its mettle ” and would itself be subject to the vigilance of other nongovernmental organisations . xxmaj this would also prevent any real risk of the use by the xxup gid of tactics such as last - minute refusals of access , claims that the applicant did not wish to see the monitors or moving him elsewhere without notification . xxmaj access by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would also prevent the applicant ’s incommunicado detention . \n",
       "  35.the xxup mou would also counteract the climate of impunity prevailing in the xxup gid and toleration of torture by its senior members . xxmaj the xxup mou and the monitoring arrangements were supported at the highest levels in xxmaj jordan – the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan ’s political power and prestige were behind the xxup mou – so it was reasonable to assume that instructions on how to treat the applicant had been given to the xxup gid and it would be aware that any breaches would not go unpunished . xxmaj moreover , senior members of the xxup gid had participated in the xxup mou negotiations and therefore would know the consequences of any failure to comply . xxmaj even if abuses were normally the work of rogue officers , the specific and unusual position of the applicant and the effect of the xxup mou would lead to senior officers preventing ill - treatment in his case , even if they did so only out of self - interest . \n",
       "  36.questioning by the xxmaj united xxmaj states was not forbidden by the xxup mou and , to xxup siac , it was probable that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj central xxmaj intelligence xxmaj agency would be allowed to question the applicant directly with the xxup gid present . xxmaj however , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would have made clear to the xxmaj united xxmaj states its interests in ensuring that the xxup mou was not breached . xxmaj the xxmaj jordanian authorities and xxmaj united xxmaj states would be careful to ensure that the xxmaj united xxmaj states did not “ overstep the mark ” . xxmaj assuming that the applicant remained in xxup gid custody and was not surrendered to the xxmaj united xxmaj states , there would be no real risk of ill - treatment at the pre - trial stage . xxmaj it was also highly unlikely that the applicant would be placed in any secret xxup gid or xxup cia detention facility in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  37.the same factors applied to any questioning which might take place soon after the conviction or acquittal of the applicant . xxmaj the xxup mou would continue to apply and it would be in the interests of both the xxmaj jordanians and the xxmaj americans to conduct any interrogation at the earliest opportunity rather than wait until after trial . xxmaj the applicant ’s high profile was also found to be “ unlikely to diminish much for some years ” . \n",
       "  38.there was little likelihood of the xxmaj jordanian authorities bringing any subsequent charges which carried the death penalty or seeking the death penalty in respect of the charges for which the applicant was to be retried . xxmaj instead , if he were convicted , the applicant would face a lengthy period of imprisonment . xxmaj there was a real risk of a life sentence in respect of the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge conspiracy , although there was a greater prospect that it would be considerably less because of the way in which sentences on the other defendants appeared to have been reduced on appeal , to 4 or 5 years . xxmaj there was no real risk of a life sentence in the millennium conspiracy retrial . xxmaj there was no rule that would prevent a higher sentence being imposed than the 15 year sentence that had been imposed in absentia . xxmaj however , the clear practice was against imposing higher sentences in retrials following initial convictions in absentia and there was no reason why a more unfavourable view would be taken of the applicant when he was present than when he was absent . xxmaj the applicant would serve any sentence in an ordinary prison and not a xxup gid detention facility ; the sentence of hard labour did not connote any additional punishment . xxmaj general conditions would not breach xxmaj article 3 and , although beatings sometimes occurred , there was no evidence that the applicant would be targeted as a political xxmaj islamist prisoner . xxmaj his status would again act to protect him . \n",
       "  39.in respect of rendition , there were “ powerful incentives ” for the xxmaj jordanian and xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj governments not to allow this to happen , not least the real domestic political difficulties this would create for the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and the unwillingness of the xxmaj united xxmaj states to destabilise the xxmaj jordanian regime . xxmaj any instances of alleged rendition from xxmaj jordan had involved people of other nationalities or , in one case , of a dual xxup us / xxmaj jordanian national . xxmaj it was also very unlikely that the applicant would be removed to a secret xxup cia facility in xxmaj jordan since this would require the connivance of the xxmaj jordanian authorities contrary to the xxup mou . xxmaj it was also unlikely that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government would seek the extradition of the applicant from xxmaj jordan when it had not sought his extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and there would be political difficulties for xxmaj jordan to accede to such a request . \n",
       "  ( d)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 5 \n",
       "  40.in relation to the applicant ’s detention following his removal to xxmaj jordan , xxup siac found that the time limits for notifying the legal authorities of an arrest ( 48 hours ) and for bringing formal charges ( 15 days ) were regularly and lawfully extended by the courts at the request of the prosecutor , in stages of up to 15 days to a maximum of 50 days . xxmaj it would therefore be compatible with xxmaj jordanian law for the applicant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a court before being charged . xxmaj such extensions were approved by a judicial authority , although not necessarily in the physical presence of the suspect . \n",
       "  xxup 41.siac noted that the xxup mou did not explicitly require that there be no extensions of time beyond the initial 15 day detention but required that a returned person be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorised by law to determine the lawfulness of his detention . xxmaj though “ promptly ” was not defined in the xxup mou , xxup siac found that this part of the xxup mou would be carried out , particularly since this was one of the earliest points at which the xxup mou would be engaged , and that the applicant ’s first appearance before a judicial authority would be within 48 hours . xxmaj it would not breach the xxup mou if the applicant were to be detained for a maximum of 50 days , by means of judicially approved 15 day extensions , or if he were absent when those later decisions were taken . xxmaj however , in reality the total period of 50 days was unlikely to be sought , even without the xxup mou , because the applicant faced a retrial and the case dossiers had already been through the trial and appeal process a number of times . \n",
       "  ( e)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 6 \n",
       "  42.it was common ground before xxup siac that the applicant ’s previous convictions would be set aside and he would face retrial before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court on the same charges . \n",
       "  43.in addition to his two challenges to the retrial process ( the impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the use of evidence obtained by torture ) the applicant also argued that he would be questioned in detention without the presence of a lawyer by the xxup gid , xxmaj united xxmaj states officials or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the latter had the power under xxmaj article 64(3 ) of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj criminal xxmaj trial xxmaj procedures xxmaj code to conduct an investigation in the absence of a lawyer “ whenever he [ deemed ] it necessary in order to reveal the truth ” . xxmaj this decision was not subject to review , though xxup siac also noted that a confession before the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was not admissible unless the individual had been warned that he need not answer questions without his lawyer present . xxup siac thought it unlikely that the applicant would have a lawyer present during questioning by the xxup gid or xxmaj united xxmaj states officials but very likely he would have access to a lawyer for any appearance before a judge or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj in terms of pre - trial preparation by the defence , the period and facilities available would be less extensive than in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom but nonetheless better than would normally be the case in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  44.with regard to the lack of independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , xxup siac found that the court would consist of three judges , at least two of whom would be legally qualified military officers with no security of tenure . xxmaj the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor would also be a military officer . xxmaj appeal would lie to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , a civilian court , though that court could not hear argument on any unfairness of the trial arising from the military composition of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . \n",
       "  45.as to the potential use of evidence obtained by torture in the applicant ’s retrial , xxup siac found as follows : \n",
       "  “ 418.the xxmaj jordanian legal system , by its terms , does not therefore permit the use of involuntary confession or incriminatory statements . xxmaj there is a judicial examination of allegations of that nature before the evidence is admitted . xxmaj those allegations can themselves be tested by evidence . xxmaj how far those allegations can be practicably tested is affected by certain features of the system . xxmaj the burden of proof for excluding confessions made to the xxmaj prosecutor lies on the defendant . xxmaj there is obvious difficulty in proving prior acts or threats by the xxup gid in the absence of systems for recording questioning , for ensuring the presence of lawyers during questioning , and independent prompt medical examinations . xxmaj there is likely to be considerable reluctance on the part of the xxmaj court to accept that confessions to the xxmaj prosecutor , a common source of evidence , are tainted by ill - treatment . xxmaj the xxmaj court or xxmaj prosecutor does not appear prepared to compel the appearance of xxup gid officials to testify about these allegations . xxmaj there may be a sense that these allegations are made routinely , as a matter of defence strategy . \n",
       "  419.there may well be a greater willingness to test the nature of confessions made only in the course of xxup gid questioning . xxmaj there is some evidence that at least at xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation level , confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture have been excluded , ( though it is not clear whether those were made to the xxup gid or to the xxmaj prosecutor ) . \n",
       "  420.however , the general background evidence and that specific to the two trials in question shows that there is at least a very real risk that the incriminating statements against the [ applicant ] were obtained as a result of treatment by the xxup gid which breached xxmaj article 3 xxup echr ; it may or may not have amounted to torture . xxmaj it is very improbable that those statements would be excluded on the retrial , because the ssct is unlikely to be persuaded that they were so obtained , particularly having already rejected that assertion at the first trials , although the makers could give evidence that they were so obtained and were in fact untrue . ” \n",
       "  xxmaj there was , therefore , a high probability that the past statements made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor which incriminated the applicant would be admitted . xxup siac further found that those statements would be of considerable , perhaps decisive , importance against him . xxmaj on this aspect of the retrial , xxup siac held : \n",
       "  “ 439.to us , the question comes back to whether or not it is unfair for the burden of proof in xxmaj jordan to lie where it does on this issue ; we do not think that to be unfair in itself . xxmaj however , this burden of proof appears to be unaccompanied by some of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment or means of assisting its proof eg video or other recording of questioning by the xxup gid , limited periods of detention for questioning , invariable presence of lawyers , routine medical examination , assistance from the xxmaj court in calling relevant officials or doctors . xxmaj the decisions are also made by a court which lacks independence and does not appear to examine closely or vigorously allegations of this nature . xxmaj it is taking these points in combination which leads us to conclude that the trial would be likely to be unfair within xxmaj article 6 because of the way the allegations about involuntary statements would be considered . ” \n",
       "  xxup 46.siac concluded that , despite its findings in respect of the independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 , there would be no flagrant denial of justice under xxmaj article 6 of the xxmaj convention if the applicant were retried in xxmaj jordan . xxup siac stated that the retrial would take place “ within a legally constructed framework covering the court system , the procedural rules and the offences ” , the applicant would be present and it would be in public . xxmaj the dossier from the original trial would be before the retrial court but the applicant could effectively challenge its contents . xxmaj the execution of xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine and the difficulty faced by other witnesses , notably xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , would not make the retrial unfair . xxup siac concluded : \n",
       "  “ 446.we accept the lack of institutional independence in the ssct . xxmaj the lack of independence for ssct xxmaj judges is in the structure and system . xxmaj there is no evidence as to why particular judges might be chosen for particular cases , or that they are ‘ leaned on’ . xxmaj but the ssct is not a mere tool of the executive : there is sound evidence that it appraises the evidence and tests it against the law , and acquits a number of defendants . xxmaj it has reduced sentences over time . \n",
       "  447.its judges have legal training and are career military lawyers . xxmaj there is a very limited basis beyond that for saying that they would be partial , and that has not been the gravamen of the complaint . xxmaj their background may well make them sceptical about allegations of abuse by the xxup gid affecting statements made to the xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj they may instinctively share the view that allegations of ill - treatment are a routine part of a defence case to excuse the incrimination of others . xxmaj the legal framework is poorly geared to detecting and acting upon allegations of abuse . xxmaj the way in which it approaches the admission of evidence , on the material we have , shows no careful scrutiny of potentially tainted evidence . xxmaj there would be considerable publicity given to the retrial and public trials can encourage greater care and impartiality in the examination of the evidence . xxmaj this would not be a mere show trial , nor were the first trials ; nor would the result be a foregone conclusion , regardless of the evidence . \n",
       "  448.reasons are given for the decisions , and an appeal to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation is available . xxmaj the fact that such an appeal can not cure the want of structural independence in the ssct is not a reason for discounting its existence in the overall assessment of whether there would be a complete denial of xxmaj article 6 rights . xxmaj this xxmaj court is a civilian court and the evidence of undue executive influence through appointment or removal is quite sparse . xxmaj there is no evidence again as to how its panels are chosen , nor that they are “ leaned on ” by the executive . xxmaj it plainly operates as a corrective to the rulings of the ssct on law and procedure , and is of some relevance to factual matters , even though it does not hear the evidence all over again or have a full factual jurisdiction except on xxmaj prosecutors’ appeals . xxmaj the probable sentences are not wholly disproportionate to the offences . \n",
       "  449.we have discussed at length the approach of the ssct to the admission of statements to a prosecutor allegedly given as a result of prior ill - treatment . xxmaj although we take the view that a contribution of factors would probably make the retrial unfair in that respect , they do not constitute a complete denial of a fair trial . xxmaj the existence of a legal prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence can not be ignored , nor the fact that the ssct would hear evidence relating to the allegations . xxmaj the role of the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation in reviewing and at times overturning the conclusions of the ssct on this issue is material . xxmaj the want of evidential or procedural safeguards to balance the burden of proof , and the probable cast of mind towards statements made to a prosecutor / judge in a civil law system , all within a security court dominated by military lawyers , does not suffice for a complete denial of justice . \n",
       "  450.there is a danger , given the inevitable focus on what is said to be potentially unfair about the retrial , in focussing exclusively on deficiencies when deciding whether there would be a total denial of the right to a fair trial , rather than looking at the picture of the trial as a whole . xxmaj that is what has to be done however and it is that picture as a whole which has led us to our conclusion on this issue . \n",
       "  451.the various factors which would be likely to cause the retrial to breach xxmaj article 6 are to a considerable degree interlinked . xxmaj taking them in the round does not persuade us that there is a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial . ” \n",
       "  47.finally , while there was the real prospect of a long term of imprisonment , this did not alter xxup siac ’s conclusion that the overall nature of the retrial would not be a total denial of the applicant ’s rights . \n",
       "  2.proceedings before the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal \n",
       "  48.the applicant appealed to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , which gave judgment on 9 xxmaj april 2008 , unanimously allowing the appeal in respect of xxmaj article 6 and the risk of the use of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 and dismissing it on all other grounds ( [ 2008 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 290 ) . \n",
       "  49.for the applicant ’s complaints under xxmaj article 3 as to the use of closed evidence by xxup siac and the reliance on the assurances in the xxup mou , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal considered it was bound by its previous ruling on these questions in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb ( xxmaj algeria ) , u ( xxmaj algeria ) v. the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department [ 2007 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 808 , which had found that : ( i ) xxup siac could consider closed evidence on safety on return ; and ( ii ) the relevance of assurances to safety on return was a matter of fact not law and thus it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on that ground . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also rejected the applicant ’s appeals based on xxmaj article 5 , finding that xxup siac was entitled to find as it did . \n",
       "  50.for xxmaj article 6 , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal rejected the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk of a “ flagrant denial of justice ” in his retrial in xxmaj jordan by reason of a lack of independence and or impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court : xxup siac had been entitled to find as it did on this point and this conclusion was not altered by the later decision of this xxmaj court in almoayad v. xxmaj germany ( dec . ) , no . 35865 / 03 , 20 xxmaj february 2007 . \n",
       "  51.however , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal accepted the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk that he would suffer a “ flagrant denial of justice ” by reason of the risk that statements obtained through treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 would be admitted as evidence against him in his retrial . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed : \n",
       "  “ xxup 45.siac understated or misunderstood the fundamental nature in xxmaj convention law of the prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by torture . xxmaj counsel for the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state said that it was no part of his submission to say that if it is clear that a trial will take place on the basis of evidence obtained under torture , whether of the individual themselves , or third parties , that that would not involve flagrant denial of justice . xxmaj accordingly , once xxup siac had found as a fact that there was a high probability that evidence that may very well have been obtained by torture ( xxup siac , 436 ) ; or in respect of which there was a very real risk that it had been obtained by torture or other conduct breaching article 3 ( xxup siac , 437 ) ; would be admitted at the trial of mrothman ; then xxup siac had to be satisfied that such evidence would be excluded or not acted on . xxmaj the grounds relied on by xxup siac for not finding a threatened breach of article 6 in that respect were insufficient . \n",
       "  46.we emphasise that that is not or not primarily a criticism of xxup siac ’s reasoning in terms of rationality , though we do consider additionally that xxup siac ’s conclusions did not follow rationally from its findings of fact . xxmaj rather , our principal finding is that xxup siac erred by applying an insufficiently demanding test to determine the issue of whether article 6 rights would be breached . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  48.the use of evidence obtained by torture is prohibited in xxmaj convention law not just because that will make the trial unfair , but also and more particularly because of the connexion of the issue with article 3 , a fundamental , unconditional and non - derogable prohibition that stands at the centre of the xxmaj convention protections . xxmaj as the ecthr put it in 105 of its judgment in xxmaj jalloh v xxmaj germany 44 xxup ehrr 32 : \n",
       "  ‘ incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture - should never be relied on as proof of the victim ’s guilt , irrespective of its probative value . xxmaj any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of xxmaj art.3 of the xxmaj convention sought to proscribe or , as it was so well put in the xxup us xxmaj supreme xxmaj court ’s judgment in the xxmaj rochin case 342 xxup us 165 , “ to afford brutality the cloak of law”.’ \n",
       "  xxmaj that view , that the use of evidence obtained by torture or ill - treatment is prohibited not just , or indeed primarily , because of its likely unreliability , but rather because the state must stand firm against the conduct that has produced the evidence , is universally recognised both within and outside xxmaj convention law . \n",
       "  xxmaj what is , with respect , a particularly strong statement to that effect , citing a multitude of equally strongly worded authorities , is to be found in 17 of the speech of xxmaj lord xxmaj bingham in a v xxmaj home xxmaj secretary ( xxmaj no2 ) [ 2006 ] 2 xxup ac 221 . \n",
       "  xxup 49.siac was wrong not to recognise this crucial difference between breaches of article 6 based on this ground and breaches of article 6 based simply on defects in the trial process or in the composition of the court . xxmaj rather , in its conclusions in 442452 of its determination ... it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the independence of the court : see in particular xxup siac at 449 - 450 . xxmaj that caused it not to recognise the high degree of assurance that is required in relation to proceedings in a foreign state before a person may lawfully be deported to face a trial that may involve evidence obtained by torture . ” \n",
       "  52.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal noted that xxup siac had reached its conclusion that there would not be a complete denial of justice in relation to the use of evidence obtained by torture by relying on the process , admittedly not wholly satisfactory , before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation . xxmaj for the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal that conclusion sat very ill with xxup siac ’s own findings about the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court process , in particular xxup siac ’s own concern as to the difficulties in proving that evidence had been obtained by torture . xxmaj in the opinion of the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , xxup siac ’s concern was “ amply justified by the litany of lack of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment ” in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj it also criticised xxup siac ’s “ disturbing failure ” to give proper weight to the findings as to the defects in the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj it was not open to xxup siac to conclude on that evidence that the risk of the total denial of justice that is represented by the use of evidence obtained by torture had been adequately excluded . xxup siac could not have so concluded if it had properly understood the status in xxmaj convention law of this aspect of article 6 . ” \n",
       "  3.proceedings before the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords \n",
       "  53.the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state appealed to the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords in relation to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal ’s conclusion on xxmaj article 6 . xxmaj the applicant cross - appealed in relation to his other xxmaj convention complaints . xxmaj the appeal was heard with the appeals of two of the appellants in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb and u ( see paragraph 48 above ) . xxmaj in the conjoined appeals the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords was therefore able to consider the use of closed material before xxup siac , the reliance on the assurances contained in the xxup mou and the applicant ’s xxmaj articles5 and 6 complaints . xxmaj the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords gave judgment on 18february 2009 unanimously allowing the xxmaj government ’s appeal and dismissing the applicant ’s cross - appeal ( [ 2009 ] xxup ukhl 10 ) . \n",
       "  ( a)article 3 : the “ closed ” proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  54.lord xxmaj phillips held that xxup siac was lawfully entitled to consider closed material in evaluating safety on return and there were cogent considerations of policy for doing so . a distinction had to be drawn between closed material on safety on return and the use of closed material in other proceedings , for example to establish the national security threat posed by an individual . xxmaj for the former , the individual would normally be aware of the nature of any risk on return and , in any event , it was for the individual himself , and not the xxmaj state , to make out his case on whether he would be at risk on return . xxmaj it was not likely to be critically important for a special advocate to be able to obtain input from the person to be deported in relation to closed evidence . xxmaj as regards the impracticality of obtaining an appropriate expert witness with security clearance to see the material , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips did not regard the problem as unfair . xxup siac ’s rules of procedure enabled the special advocate to ask xxup siac to call for more evidence and xxup siac , as an expert tribunal , could be relied upon “ to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate ’s submission ” . xxmaj in respect of the assurances , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips endorsed the view that the assurances contained in the xxup mou had to be disclosed but details of the negotiations leading to the xxup mou could be closed material . \n",
       "  55.lord xxmaj hoffmann rejected the applicant ’s argument on the more fundamental basis that he viewed this xxmaj court ’s case - law as making it clear that the determination whether a deportation order might infringe xxmaj article 3 did not require “ the full judicial panoply of article 6 or even 5(4 ) ” . xxmaj citing xxmaj chahal , cited above , he emphasised that all that was required was “ independent scrutiny of the claim ” , which had occurred in the applicant ’s case . \n",
       "  56.lord xxmaj hope agreed , albeit accepting that this xxmaj court had not yet had the opportunity to analyse whether the xxup siac system met the requirements of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj in his view , it did so . xxmaj lord xxmaj brown also agreed , emphasising that with regard to safety on return , no case was being made against the applicant ; rather it was he who was making a case against the returning xxmaj state . \n",
       "  ( b)article 3 : assurances and the xxup mou \n",
       "  57.lord xxmaj phillips ( with whom the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords agreed ) construed the this xxmaj court ’s case - law from xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , onwards as treating assurances “ as part of the matrix that had to be considered ” when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would face treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj he referred to the “ abundance ” of international law material , which supported the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by xxmaj state agents was endemic . xxmaj however , for xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips this came “ close to a ‘ xxmaj catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you can not rely on them ” . xxmaj in rejecting that proposition , he held that the only basis to interfere with the view of xxup siac was if its conclusions that the assurances could be relied upon were irrational and xxup siac ’s conclusions in the present case were not . \n",
       "  ( c)article 5 \n",
       "  58.the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords unanimously refused to interfere with the finding of fact by xxup siac that the applicant ’s exposure under xxmaj jordanian law to 50 days’ detention without access to a court or a lawyer , would not arise . xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found that , even if it would arise , 50 days’ detention would not constitute a flagrant breach of xxmaj article 5 . a flagrant breach was a breach whose consequences were so severe that they overrode the right of a xxmaj state to expel an alien from its territory . xxmaj that might be satisfied by arbitrary detention which lasted many years but not 50 days’ detention . \n",
       "  ( d)article 6 \n",
       "  59.on xxmaj article 6 , taking the test to be whether there would be a “ complete denial or nullification ” of the right to a fair trial , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips observed : \n",
       "  “ 136.this is neither an easy nor an adequate test of whether article 6 should bar the deportation of an alien . xxmaj in the first place it is not easy to postulate what amounts to ‘ a complete denial or nullification of the right to a fair trial’ . xxmaj that phrase can not require that every aspect of the trial process should be unfair . ... xxmaj what is required is that the deficiency or deficiencies in the trial process should be such as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of the prospective trial . \n",
       "  137.in the second place , the fact that the deportee may find himself subject in the receiving country to a legal process that is blatantly unfair can not , of itself , justify placing an embargo on his deportation . xxmaj the focus must be not simply on the unfairness of the trial process but on its potential consequences . xxmaj an unfair trial is likely to lead to the violation of substantive human rights and the extent of that prospective violation must plainly be an important factor in deciding whether deportation is precluded . ” \n",
       "  60.having reviewed , the relevant case - law of this xxmaj court , including xxmaj bader and xxmaj kanbor v. xxmaj sweden , no . 13284 / 04 , 42 , xxup echr xxup 2005xi , which he took to exemplify the need to consider the risk of a violation of xxmaj article 6 in combination with other xxmaj articles such as xxmaj articles 2 and 3 , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he xxmaj strasbourg jurisprudence , tentative though it is , has led me to these conclusions . xxmaj before the deportation of an alien will be capable of violating article 6 there must be substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk ( i ) that there will be a fundamental breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 and ( ii ) that this failure will lead to a miscarriage of justice that itself constitutes a flagrant violation of the victim ’s fundamental rights . ” \n",
       "  61.in the present case , the second limb was met by the potential sentences of imprisonment the applicant faced . xxmaj for the first limb , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips concluded that , although the military constitution of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court would render the trial contrary to xxmaj article 6 if it were held in a xxmaj convention xxmaj state , he agreed with xxup siac and the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , that it could not amount to a “ flagrant denial of justice ” sufficient to prevent deportation in a removal case . \n",
       "  62.in respect of the applicant ’s complaint that there was a real risk that the evidence against him had been obtained by torture , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips held that the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal erred . xxmaj it had required too high a degree of assurance that evidence that might have been obtained by torture would not be used in a foreign trial . xxmaj he stated : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he prohibition on receiving evidence obtained by torture is not primarily because such evidence is unreliable or because the reception of the evidence will make the trial unfair . xxmaj rather it is because ‘ the state must stand firm against the conduct that produced the evidence’ . xxmaj that principle applies to the state in which an attempt is made to adduce such evidence . xxmaj it does not require this state , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , to retain in this country to the detriment of national security a terrorist suspect unless it has a high degree of assurance that evidence obtained by torture will not be adduced against him in xxmaj jordan ... xxmaj the issue before xxup siac was whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that if xxmaj mr xxmaj othman were deported to xxmaj jordan the criminal trial that he would there face would have defects of such significance as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of his trial or , as xxup siac put it , to amount to a total denial of the right to a fair trial . xxup siac concluded that the deficiencies that xxup siac had identified did not meet that exacting test . i do not find that in reaching this conclusion xxup siac erred in law . ” \n",
       "  63.lord xxmaj hoffmann found that there was no xxmaj convention authority for the rule that , in the context of the application of xxmaj article 6 to a removal case , the risk of the use of evidence obtained by torture necessarily amounted to a flagrant denial of justice . \n",
       "  64.lord xxmaj hope agreed . xxmaj he accepted that this xxmaj court had adopted an “ uncompromising approach ” to the use at trial of evidence obtained by torture but the evidence before xxup siac did not come up to that standard . xxmaj there were allegations but no proof . xxmaj the assertion that there was a real risk that the evidence was obtained by torture was not enough to prohibit removal . xxmaj he recalled xxup siac ’s findings that the retrial would probably not comply with xxmaj article 6 if xxmaj jordan were a party to the xxmaj convention but would take place within a legally constructed framework . xxmaj there was sound evidence that the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , which was not a mere tool of the executive , appraised the evidence and tested it against the law . xxup siac had therefore been entitled to find as it did on the evidence . \n",
       "  65.lord xxmaj brown agreed with xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips and , referring to the majority of the xxmaj grand xxmaj chamber in xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , stated : “ if extradition was not unlawful even in the circumstances arising there , in my judgment expulsion most certainly is not unlawful here . ” \n",
       "  66.lord xxmaj mance , who agreed with the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords on xxmaj article 6 and all other points of appeal , noted a considerable resemblance between the concept of “ flagrant unfairness ” in this xxmaj court ’s case - law and the concept of denial of justice in public international law generally . xxmaj for the latter , the modern consensus was that the factual circumstances had to be egregious for xxmaj state responsibility to arise in international law . \n",

       "  xxmaj the reasons given by the judge included the following considerations : \n",
       "  \" a landlord 's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances , his living conditions and / or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future . \n",
       "  xxmaj in that connection , the following facts have already been established : that ' since his marriage , in xxmaj april 1979 , xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto has lived with his parents - in - law in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , [ xxmaj funchal ] ' ; that ' xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , one of xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's brothers and two of her aunts ... lived in the house ' ; that ' the plaintiffs ' house has three bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom ' ; that ' the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ' ; that ' xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents - in - law , who are at present the sole occupants , with xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , of the house in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' ; and that ' the plaintiffs both work in xxmaj funchal ' . \n",
       "  xxmaj it should be noted that xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need . xxmaj the plaintiffs ' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought , since they even have a bedroom for their son . \n",
       "  xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving , as the onus was on them to do , that the relations between themselves and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents were permanently strained and conflictual . xxmaj what is certain , however , is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son 's illness and their living conditions in that house . \n",
       "  xxmaj it might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with xxunk xxmaj barreto 's parents , ' who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' - that in view of the xxunk ' xxmaj when a man marries he needs a house ' , cited by xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto in his first application , the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  xxmaj however , each case is unique . xxmaj regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims , but not established , and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity , to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion , in the light of everyday experience , it can not be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there . \n",

       "  xxmaj each couple has a bedroom and the plaintiffs ' son has his . xxmaj and there is still one bedroom left over . \n",
       "  xxmaj the judgment must reflect the situation at the conclusion of the evidence and argument ( xxmaj article 663 para . 1 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation , the fact that they live with xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , albeit by their favour , is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by xxmaj article 1096 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ... xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house . \n",
       "  xxmaj derogation from the general principle and eviction of the tenant for the benefit of the landlord are possible only where it appears to be absolutely necessary , for weighty reasons , for the landlord to live in the property ( xxmaj article 1095 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ) . \n",

       "  xxmaj in addition , the prosecuting authorities noted that , in spite of the evidence submitted to the investigation file , the decision of 20 xxmaj september 1995 had not examined the liability of the head of the xxmaj patriotic xxmaj guards , xxmaj colonel xxup p.c. , nor that of the servicemen who had played a role in organising the procedure for executing the orders issued by the xxmaj head of xxmaj state or his xxmaj ministers . \n",
       "  xxmaj the prosecuting authorities noted that evidence had not been taken from certain injured parties during the investigation ; that servicemen belonging to those regiments which had been deployed to quell the demonstrators had not been questioned ; that the registers kept by the military units involved in the repression had not been requested and thus not checked ; and that the investigation had not considered the possible involvement of other public institutions , such as , for example , the use of vehicles belonging to the xxmaj post xxmaj office for transporting prisoners . \n",
       "  33.by a decision of the same day , namely 7 xxmaj december 2004 , the military prosecutor ’s office ordered the indictment of 102 persons , essentially officers , including high - ranking officers , from the xxmaj army , police and xxmaj securitate forces , for murder ( xxmaj articles 174 - 176 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , genocide ( xxmaj article357 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , inhuman treatment ( xxmaj article 358 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , attempts to commit those acts , complicity and instigation in the commission of the above acts and participation lato sensu ( participaţie improprie ) in them , acts committed “ during the period from 21to 30 xxmaj december 1989 ” . xxmaj sixteen civilians , including a former xxmaj president of xxmaj romania and a former xxmaj head of the xxmaj romanian xxmaj intelligence xxmaj service , were also charged . \n",

       "  xxmaj all of the servicemen who were in xxmaj braşov city centre that night , the vast majority of whom gave evidence , stated that they were tired , as the majority had been posted there since the previous night , namely 21 to 22 xxmaj december 1989 , that they were all afraid , because they had learned what was happening in xxmaj bucharest and that , on their own initiative , they had loaded their weapons , since they were expecting to be attacked from one moment to the next . \n",
       "  xxmaj in those circumstances , it had been sufficient that civilian xxup i.e. fire the first shots in the direction of persons whom he considered suspect for all of the servicemen in the city centre to open fire in turn , without prior orders from their commanders ... \n",
       "  xxmaj all of the armed individuals – both servicemen and civilians – who used their weapons in the city centre during the night of 22 to 23 xxmaj december 1989 were acting in good faith and were attached to the revolution , and were convinced that they were acting to protect it . xxmaj they used their weapons on account of the prevailing confusion and the considerable fear and suspicion which had taken hold of everyone who was in the streets . ” \n",

       "  “ xxmaj in support of her application for the annulment of the decision to give up the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 and for the child ’s return , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk alleges that an error was committed as to the meaning and scope of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 . \n",

       "  xxmaj the exercise by any woman of this right , which is enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , is governed by the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 222 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code , as amended by the xxmaj act of 22 xxmaj january 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj it appears from the evidence before the court ... that at least two lengthy interviews were held in order to explain to this woman the conditions and effects of anonymous registration of a birth . xxmaj these interviews took place in the presence of xxmaj english speakers , and xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , who chose to come to xxmaj france to give birth , can not expect the social services to have offered anything more in this respect , particularly not the presence of an official interpreter , which is not provided for or required by any statutory instrument . xxmaj furthermore , it appears from the proceedings ... and from the written submissions summarising her counsel ’s address ... that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was taken to hospital by a lawyer ; she had therefore clearly sought legal advice prior to the birth . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , no matter what psychological state the applicant may have been in , like any woman opting to give birth in these circumstances , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was nevertheless fully aware of both the immediate and the future implications of her actions and decisions . xxmaj she thus acted quite consciously in having the birth registered anonymously and giving the child up to the social services to be taken into xxmaj state care , and there are no grounds for arguing that her intellectual faculties were impaired or that the consent was invalid in any way ; moreover , the question of consent is not applicable from a civil - status perspective . \n",
       "  xxmaj in addition , as regards the formal propriety of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , once a child is entrusted to the social services , the latter assume a number of obligations , including the provision of information ... xxmaj it appears from the record of the child ’s placement , which contains entries whose existence is not disputed , that the social services fulfilled their obligation to provide information on a child ’s placement in xxmaj state care and the ensuing legal effects . xxmaj such information was , moreover , provided in xxmaj english , and the notice and model letter requesting the return of the child were indeed given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk fully understood the meaning and scope of this information since she left documents for the child in the event that the latter expressed the wish to discover her origins at a future date . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk clearly expressed her wish that the child should never be able to have legal ties to her . xxmaj moreover , she did not withdraw her consent within the two - month period . xxmaj it should be noted in this connection that this right is strictly personal ; accordingly , no action by a third person may be treated as an action to withdraw consent , that being the sole prerogative of the mother , or interrupt the relevant period . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , there are no grounds for declaring null and void the record of 19february 2002 , which served as an entirely valid basis for the placement in xxmaj state care ( first provisionally and later with final effect ) of the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 with no established parentage ... \n",
       "  xxmaj since the mother did not apply for the return of the child within two months after giving her up , the child , who has no legally established parentage , was able to be placed with foster parents by the xxmaj state authorities with a view to her adoption under xxmaj article 351 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj such placement for adoption , by virtue of the provisions of xxmaj article 352 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , constitutes a bar not only to the return of the child to the mother but also to any declaration of filiation or recognition . xxmaj the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared ineffective . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk further alleges a violation of xxmaj articles 13 and 14 of the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights . \n",
       "  xxmaj as stated above , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk gave birth ... while wishing to keep the birth and her identity secret , a right enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and given effect by the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj more generally , these xxmaj articles govern the conditions for giving up a child , for consent to adoption or for anonymous registration of a birth , as well as the conditions and procedures applicable in the event of repudiation and / or withdrawal of any of these measures . \n",
       "  xxmaj they strike a delicate balance between the rights of a mother , which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , to give birth anonymously with the consequences that entails , and the rights of the foster parents and of the child , whose rights are now framed in such a way as to allow him or her access to more information , if he or she so desires , but in whose interests stability and certainty , both psychological and legal , must be sought , if only through the shortness of the time within which the natural parents may avail themselves of the appropriate procedures . \n",
       "  xxmaj the instant case thus can not be said to involve any discrimination or deprivation of the enjoyment of a right secured to the mother or the child by the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights , or indeed our national law , within the meaning of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj similarly , no matter how short they are , time - limits do exist in xxmaj french law for bringing an action in the ordinary courts , constituting , within the meaning of xxmaj article 13 of the xxmaj convention ... , an effective remedy before a national authority independent of the administrative authority that may be required to rule on an application for the return of a child or to approve an adoption . ” \n",
       "  22.the applicant appealed . xxmaj in a judgment of 22 xxmaj september 2003 the xxmaj douai xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal set aside the first - instance judgment . xxmaj after reiterating the content of the record of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , and in particular the information it provided , the court held : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj paragraph 3 of the section on information thus expressly mentions the existence of two time - limits for the child ’s return without any further formalities , one being two months ( the only possible limit that could apply in the instant case ) , the other being six months , where the second parent has not entrusted the child to the social services . \n",
       "  xxmaj this six - month time - limit is mentioned on two further occasions , firstly in relation to the right to have the child returned to the second parent and secondly in indicating that even after the expiry of the two - month and six - month periods , a court action may still be brought . \n",
       "  xxmaj this information could have misled xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... since in reality the six - month time - limit applicable under xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code in the circumstances referred to in xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 did not apply in the instant case , there being no established paternity as the mother had registered the birth anonymously , and the placement therefore came under point ( 1 ) of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national who is a native xxmaj english speaker and does not speak xxmaj french , could not have known the consequences in xxmaj french law of anonymous registration of the birth , in terms of her rights and those of the biological father , and the information given was in no way capable of xxunk her in a clear and precise manner . \n",
       "  xxmaj having been informed of the existence of a six - month time - limit where ‘ the child has a second parent who did not entrust him or her to the service’ , she may legitimately have thought , in the light of the information set out in the record , that this time - limit was applicable in her case since she had on several occasions notified the local health and social services department of the existence of a biological father who had not been informed of the placement procedure . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will be observed that there is no mention in the record that an interpreter was present when it was signed and that it has not been disputed that a member of the maternity ward staff assisted with the translation and the explanation in xxmaj english of the information given in xxmaj french to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... xxmaj however , a translation of this nature , which was provided by a person who used xxmaj english only occasionally and did not have specific legal knowledge , and which , moreover , was based on particularly ambiguous information as to the time - limits , did not enable xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... to have access to proper information about her rights regarding the procedures for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj it therefore appears that the information provided to the appellant concerning the right to have the child returned was inaccurate or at least particularly ambiguous , and was set out in a pre - printed document not specially adapted to the procedure of anonymous birth registration but designed for use in any of the circumstances covered by xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code for the taking of a child into xxmaj state care ; that reference was made to a six - month time - limit not applicable in her case ; and that , moreover , being an native xxmaj english speaker , the mother was not effectively informed of the procedures for the return of her child and of the strict two - month time - limit that applied in her case . \n",
       "  xxmaj furthermore , it has not been shown in any way that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... otherwise received any clear information before the record was signed as to her right to recover the child . \n",
       "  xxmaj the note by xxmaj ms xxup f. – who also drew up the record in issue – besides having no evidential value , since it was written by a party to the proceedings , does not contain any clarification as to the information given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... about the time - limit for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , the fact that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... was in contact with a xxmaj french lawyer prior to the birth does not mean that she received precise information from him about the exclusive nature of the two - month time - limit ... \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk belief ... in the possibility of recovering the child within a six - month period is corroborated by the request she made in person on 25 and 26 xxmaj july 2002 to the xxmaj nord health and social services department , citing this time - limit , and by the subsequent letters from her lawyer , which also state that his client thought that she could take her child back within such a period . \n",
       "  xxmaj having regard to all these considerations , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... placed her child in xxmaj state care while believing – legitimately , in view of the ambiguous information she had received when signing the record of the placement – that she could take her back within a period of six months and that this time - limit also applied to xxmaj mr xxup b. , who had , moreover , instituted proceedings in xxmaj ireland on 9april 2002 . \n",

       "  8.the applicant was convicted on 21 xxmaj february 2007 , at the age of twenty , of two counts of possession of xxmaj class a drugs with intent to supply . xxmaj he pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in 2005 , in which the applicant had been shot . xxmaj he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment , and on 18october 2007 was notified of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s intention to deport him . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom since the age of three . xxmaj his aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at the age of five , and the first official record of his presence was when he was eight years old . xxmaj even allowing for his long stay in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , only four years had been with valid leave . xxmaj it was believed that he was in contact with his mother , who remained in xxmaj nigeria , and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority , the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances . xxmaj it was not accepted that he had family life in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",

       "  21.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test . xxmaj it required firstly , that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity . xxmaj secondly , there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj the court also found , thirdly , that because of the “ foreign ” nature of expulsion cases , the threshold for what would meet the threshold of xxmaj article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving xxmaj state but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness . xxmaj fourthly , a risk of suicide could , in principle , form the basis of a successful claim under xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj fifthly , an important factor in determining whether removal would breach xxmaj article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill - treatment in the receiving xxmaj state , if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide , was objectively well - founded . a fear found not to be objectively well - founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj finally , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and / or receiving xxmaj states had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide . xxmaj the existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of xxmaj article 3 as a result of removal . \n",
       "  22.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages , namely , in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , in transit , and in the receiving xxmaj state . xxmaj the threshold for xxmaj article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving xxmaj state was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in the case of the particular appellant , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal found that the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities ; that the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state would provide appropriately qualified xxunk and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport ; and that in light of the finding that the applicant ’s fears of return to xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka were not objectively well - founded , and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that xxmaj state , the risk of suicide in xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka would not reach the very high threshold of xxmaj article 3 . \n",

       "  b.previous criminal proceedings in xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  1.the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge xxmaj trial \n",
       "  9.in xxmaj april 1999 , the applicant was convicted in absentia in xxmaj jordan of conspiracy to cause explosions , in a trial known as the “ reform and challenge ” case . xxmaj he was the twelfth of thirteen defendants . \n",
       "  10.the case involved an allegation of a conspiracy to carry out bombings in xxmaj jordan , which resulted in successful attacks on the xxmaj american xxmaj school and the xxmaj jerusalem xxmaj hotel in xxmaj amman in 1998 . xxmaj there were further convictions for offences of membership of a terrorist group , but these matters were the subject of a general amnesty . xxmaj the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the conclusion of the trial . \n",
       "  11.during the trial , one witness , xxmaj mohamed xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine , confessed that he and not the defendants had been involved in the bombings . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court hearing the case took the view that his confession was false , and demonstrably so , because of discrepancies between what he said about the nature of the explosives , for example , and other technical evidence . mral - xxmaj jeramaine was later executed for homicides for which he had been convicted in another trial . \n",
       "  12.the applicant maintains that the evidence against him was predominantly based upon an incriminating statement from a co - defendant , xxmaj abdul xxmaj nasser xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher ( also known as xxmaj al - xxmaj khamayseh ) . xxmaj in his confession to the xxmaj public ( or xxmaj state ) xxmaj prosecutor , xxmaj mr xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher alleged that the applicant had provided prior encouragement for the attacks . xxmaj he was also said to have congratulated the group after the attacks . \n",
       "  13.mr xxmaj al xxmaj hamasher , along with several other defendants , had complained during the proceedings before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court that they had been tortured by the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj general xxmaj intelligence xxmaj directorate ( “ the xxup gid ” ) , which shares responsibility for maintaining internal security and monitoring security threats in xxmaj jordan with the xxmaj public xxmaj security xxmaj directorate and the military . xxmaj at the end of the period of interrogation during which they claimed to have been tortured , the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor took a statement from each defendant . \n",
       "  14.at the trial there was evidence from lawyers and medical examiners and relatives of the defendants that there were visible signs of torture on the defendants . xxmaj however , the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court concluded that the defendants could not prove torture . \n",
       "  15.there were a number of appeals to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and remittals back to the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , although , as the applicant had been convicted in absentia , no appeals were taken on his behalf . xxmaj in the course of those appeals , the convictions were upheld on the basis that the relevant statements had been made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the confessions in those statements thus constituted sufficient evidence for conviction if the court accepted them and if the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was satisfied with the confessions . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected the claim that the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor had to prove that the defendants had confessed to him of their own accord : the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor ’s obligation to prove that a confession was obtained willingly only arose where the confession had not been obtained by him . xxmaj the confessions in question were authentic and there was no evidence that they had been made under financial or moral coercion . \n",
       "  16.the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation then considered the impact of the allegations that the confessions to the xxmaj state xxmaj prosecutor had resulted from coercion of the defendants and their families while they were in xxup gid detention . xxmaj such conduct during an investigation was against xxmaj jordanian law and rendered the perpetrators liable to punishment . xxmaj however , even assuming that the defendants’ allegations were true , that would not nullify the confessions made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor unless it were proved that those confessions were the consequence of illegal coercion to force the defendants to confess to things which they had not done . xxmaj the defendants had not shown that was the case . \n",
       "  17.as a result of the applicant ’s conviction in this trial , the xxmaj jordanian authorities requested the applicant ’s extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in early 2000 , the request was withdrawn by xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  2.the millennium conspiracy trial \n",
       "  18.in the autumn of 2000 the applicant was again tried in absentia in xxmaj jordan , this time in a case known as the “ millennium conspiracy ” , which concerned a conspiracy to cause explosions at western and xxmaj israeli targets in xxmaj jordan to coincide with the millennium celebrations . xxmaj the conspiracy was uncovered before the attacks could be carried out . xxmaj the applicant was alleged to have provided money for a computer and encouragement through his writings , which had been found at the house of a co - defendant , mrabuhawsher . xxmaj the applicant maintains that the main evidence against him was the testimony of xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher . \n",
       "  19.most of the defendants were convicted on most charges ; some were fully or partly acquitted . xxmaj the applicant was convicted and sentenced to 15years’ imprisonment with hard labour . xxmaj other defendants , including abuhawsher , were sentenced to death . xxmaj on appeal certain of the defendants , including , it appears , xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , claimed to have been tortured during 50days of interrogation when they were denied access to lawyers . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected this ground of appeal , holding that the minutes of interrogation showed that each defendant had been told of his right to remain silent about the charges unless their lawyer was present . xxmaj the applicant also states that the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation found that the alleged ill - treatment in xxup gid custody was irrelevant because the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court did not rely on the defendants’ confessions to the xxup gid but their confessions to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher remains under sentence of death . \n",
       "  20.the findings of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj special xxmaj immigration xxmaj appeals xxmaj commission ( xxup siac ) in respect of the evidence presented at each trial are set out at paragraph 45 below . xxmaj the further evidence which has become available since xxup siac ’s findings , and which has been submitted to this xxmaj court , is summarised as paragraphs 94–105 below . \n",
       "  c.the agreement of a memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  21.in xxmaj october 2001 , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office advised the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government that xxmaj article 3 of the xxmaj convention precluded the deportation of terrorist suspects to xxmaj jordan . xxmaj in xxmaj march 2003 , after a xxmaj government review of the possibility of removing such barriers to removal , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office confirmed that its advice of xxmaj october 2001 remained extant but that it was considering whether key countries would be willing and able to provide the appropriate assurances to guarantee that potential deportees would be treated in a manner consistent with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ’s obligations . xxmaj in xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj foreign xxmaj secretary agreed that seeking specific and credible assurances from foreign governments , in the form of memoranda of understanding , might be a way of enabling deportation from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  22.in xxmaj november 2003 , the xxmaj british xxmaj embassy in xxmaj amman was instructed to raise the idea of a framework memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) with the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj in xxmaj february 2005 , after meetings between the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan , and between the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj foreign xxmaj minister , agreement was reached on the principle of an xxup mou . \n",
       "  23.further negotiations took place in xxmaj june 2005 and an xxup mou was signed on 10 xxmaj august 2005 . xxmaj that xxup mou set out a series of assurances of compliance with international human rights standards , which would be adhered to when someone was returned to one xxmaj state from the other ( see paragraph 76 below ) . xxmaj the same day , a side letter from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj charg d’affaires , xxmaj amman , to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior was signed , which recorded the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government ’s ability to give assurances in individual cases that the death penalty would not be imposed . xxmaj in respect of the applicant , further questions as to the conduct of any retrial he would face after deportation were also put to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and answered in xxmaj may 2006 by the xxmaj legal xxmaj adviser at the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of xxmaj foreign xxmaj affairs . \n",
       "  24.the xxup mou also made provision for any person returned under it to contact and have prompt and regular visits from a representative of an independent body nominated jointly by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordanian xxmaj governments . xxmaj on 24 xxmaj october 2005 , the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre for xxmaj human xxmaj rights xxmaj studies ( “ the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ” ) signed a monitoring agreement with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government . xxmaj on 13 xxmaj february 2006 , the terms of reference for the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre were agreed ( see paragraph 80 below ) . \n",
       "  d.the applicant ’s appeal against deportation \n",
       "  25.on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , that is , the day after the xxup mou was signed , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with the notice of intention to deport . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state certified that the decision to deport the applicant was taken in the interests of national security . xxmaj the applicant appealed to xxup siac against that decision arguing , inter alia , that it was incompatible with xxmaj articles 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj relying on his previous asylum claim , he argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the xxmaj jordanian authorities . xxmaj if returned , he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would thus face lengthy pre - trial detention ( in breach of xxmaj article 5 ) and , if convicted , would face a long term of imprisonment . xxmaj all these factors meant he was at real risk of torture , either pre - trial or after conviction , to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons . xxmaj he was also at risk of the death penalty or rendition to other countries , such as the xxmaj united xxmaj states of xxmaj america . xxmaj relying on xxmaj article 6 , he alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair : the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , a military court , lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture – either of him , his co - defendants or other prisoners – would be admitted against him . \n",
       "  1.proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  ( a)the conduct of proceedings before xxup siac and its national security findings \n",
       "  26.the applicant ’s appeal was dismissed by xxup siac on 26 xxmaj february 2007 . xxmaj the appeal had been heard by xxup siac in two parts : an “ open session ” , where the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case and evidence was presented in the presence of the applicant and his representatives , and a “ closed session ” where parts of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case which could not be disclosed for security reasons were presented ( see paragraph 69 below ) . xxup siac heard evidence in closed session relating to the process by which the xxup mou had been agreed , the extent to which it would mitigate the risk of torture and also evidence as to the national security threat the applicant was alleged to have posed to the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ( “ closed material ” ) . xxmaj in the closed sessions , the applicant and his representatives were excluded but his interests were represented by special advocates . xxup siac then delivered an “ open judgment ” , which is publicly available , and a “ closed judgment ” , which was given only to the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state and the special advocates . \n",
       "  27.in reaching its decision as to whether the applicant ’s deportation was necessary in the interests of national security , xxup siac considered the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case to be “ well proved ” since the applicant was regarded by many terrorists as a spiritual adviser whose views legitimised acts of violence . xxmaj however , xxup siac did not take into account either of the applicant ’s xxmaj jordanian convictions in absentia , which were originally advanced as part of the xxmaj government ’s case . xxmaj the reason for this was that the xxmaj government had adopted what was described as a “ pragmatic approach ” in withdrawing reliance upon any evidence which it was alleged might have been obtained by torture on the grounds that it would require an investigation as to whether it was obtained by torture . xxmaj this was done in accordance the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords’ ruling in xxup a. and others ( no . 2 ) to that effect ( see paragraphs 136 and 137 below ) . \n",
       "  xxup 28.siac then reviewed the evidence it had heard from various sources including a senior xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom diplomat , xxmaj mr xxmaj mark xxmaj oakden , who gave evidence on the negotiation of the xxup mou , the monitoring agreement with the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre and on the risk faced by the applicant in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj on behalf of the applicant , it heard evidence on the xxmaj jordanian regime from three academics . xxmaj it also received evidence from an xxmaj arabic speaking barrister , msrana xxmaj refahi , who had travelled to xxmaj jordan to conduct research on the previous two trials including interviews with the defendants and their lawyers . xxmaj additionally , it considered evidence of the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government ’s interest in the applicant and allegations that a xxmaj jordanian national had been the subject of extraordinary rendition from xxmaj jordan to the xxmaj united xxmaj states . \n",
       "  ( b)siac ’s findings on the xxup mou \n",
       "  xxup 29.siac found that this xxmaj court ’s judgments in xxmaj chahal v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , 15 xxmaj november 1996 , xxmaj reports of xxmaj judgments and xxmaj decisions xxup 1996v and xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov v. xxmaj turkey [ xxup gc ] , nos . 46827 / 99 and 46951 / 99 , xxup echr xxup 2005i , showed that reliance could lawfully be placed on assurances ; but the weight to be given depended on the circumstances of each case . xxmaj there was a difference between relying on an assurance which required a xxmaj state to act in a way which would not accord with its normal law and an assurance which required a xxmaj state to adhere to what its law required but which might not be fully or regularly observed in practice . xxmaj referring to a decision of the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture , xxmaj agiza v. xxmaj sweden ( see paragraph 147 below ) , where the xxmaj swedish authorities had expelled an xxmaj egyptian national after receiving assurances from xxmaj egypt , xxup siac continued : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the case of xxmaj agiza stands as a clear warning of the dangers of simple reliance on a form of words and diplomatic monitoring . xxmaj there were already warning signs which ought to have alerted the xxmaj swedish authorities to the risks , including the role they had permitted to a foreign intelligence organisation . xxmaj but we note what to us are the crucial differences : the strength , duration and depth of the bilateral relationship between the two countries by comparison with any that has been pointed to between xxmaj sweden and xxmaj egypt ; the way in which the negotiations over the xxup mou have proceeded and the diplomatic assessment of their significance ; the particular circumstances of [ the present applicant ] and xxmaj jordan ; the degree of risk at the various stages , in the absence of the xxup mou , particularly at the early stages of detention which is when the risk from torture by the xxup gid would normally be at its greatest and when the confirmed torture of xxmaj agiza in xxmaj egypt appears to have occurred ; and the speed with which the monitors would be seeking and we believe obtaining access to the xxmaj appellant in those early days . xxmaj the xxmaj swedes felt that to seek to see xxmaj agiza would betray a want of confidence in the xxmaj egyptians , whereas there is no such feeling in either the xxup uk , the [ xxmaj adaleh ] xxmaj centre or the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj quite the reverse applies . xxmaj one aspect of that case which also troubled the [ xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture ] was that xxmaj agiza had been removed without final judicial determination of his case . xxmaj that would not be the position here . ” \n",
       "  30.in the present case , the political situation in xxmaj jordan and the freedom , albeit limited , of non - governmental organisations , the press and xxmaj parliament to express concerns would reduce the risks the applicant faced . xxmaj in addition , the level of scrutiny xxmaj jordan had accepted under the xxup mou could not but show that it was willing to abide by its terms and spirit . xxmaj each country had a real interest in preventing breaches of the xxup mou : the diplomatic relationship between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan was friendly and long - standing and of real value to xxmaj jordan and it would have a real incentive to avoid being seen as having broken its word . xxmaj both countries had an interest in maintaining co - operation on counter - terrorism matters . xxmaj the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom had a very real concern that it should be able to remove foreign nationals without breaching their rights under xxmaj article 3 , so failure in such a highly publicised case would be a major setback for that process . xxmaj that concern would thus act as a further incentive to investigate any breaches of the xxup mou . xxmaj while the xxup mou did not specify what steps would be taken in such an investigation , xxup siac accepted evidence from the xxmaj mr xxmaj oakden that any failure of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to respond to diplomatic queries would lead to “ rapidly escalating diplomatic and xxmaj ministerial contacts and reactions ” . \n",
       "  xxup 31.siac accepted that there were some weaknesses in the xxup mou and monitoring provisions . xxmaj some protections , such as prompt access to a lawyer , recorded interviews , independent medical examinations and prohibition on undisclosed places of detention , were not explicitly present but , in reality , most of these aspects were covered . xxmaj there was no guarantee that access to the applicant , as required by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s terms of reference , would always be granted but any refusal would be brought to light quite quickly ; in the early period of detention , the xxmaj centre was expected to visit the applicant three times a week . xxup siac also expected the xxup gid and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to react swiftly to any approach by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom were a visit to be refused . xxmaj it was “ disturbing ” that the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj special xxmaj rapporteur on xxmaj torture had been refused access to a xxup gid facility in xxmaj june 2006 , despite a prior arrangement that he would be permitted free access . xxmaj however , on the evidence it had heard , xxup siac found that there was no real risk of ill - treatment of the applicant by the xxup gid . xxmaj there was a weakness in the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s “ relative inexperience and scale ” ; it would be undertaking a task which would be new to it ; and it did not have the expertise among its staff , as it had recognised . xxmaj it was a fairly new body with limited resources and staff , although this could be overcome and the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government would bear the cost . xxmaj it was the very fact of monitoring visits which was important and the absence of specialist expertise was not fatal to their value . \n",
       "  ( c)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 3 \n",
       "  32.the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government did not contest the general thrust of the available material in relation to xxmaj jordan ’s human rights record and , in xxup siac ’s view , details of human rights violations in xxmaj jordan remained relevant to the assessment of the risk faced by the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj government also took the position that it could not return the applicant to xxmaj jordan , in conformity with its international obligations , in the absence of the particular measures contained in the xxup mou . xxmaj nevertheless , xxup siac found it important to consider the risks faced by the applicant by reference to the likely sequence of events if he were to be returned . xxmaj it found that the xxup mou might not be necessary for each risk but rather reinforce the protection available . \n",
       "  xxup 33.siac accepted that , on return , the applicant would be taken into the custody of the xxup gid and retried on the two charges for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would be accompanied by a representative of the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre to his place of detention and be medically examined . xxup siac also accepted that the xxup gid would interrogate the applicant with a view to obtaining a confession for use at trial and for more general intelligence purposes , though xxup siac found it to be speculative that xxup gid would interrogate the applicant about other offences in order to bring further charges against him ; there was no evidence of any other charges outstanding . xxup siac also accepted that the xxmaj united xxmaj states would seek to question the applicant and that this would take place soon after his arrival in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj however , there was no real risk that xxmaj article 3 would be breached before the conclusion of the retrial . \n",
       "  34.there was a real risk of torture or ill - treatment of an “ ordinary xxmaj islamist extremist ” in xxup gid detention before charge since such ill - treatment was widespread and longstanding and there was a climate of impunity and evasion of international monitoring in the xxup gid . xxmaj however , the applicant would be protected by his high profile , by the xxup mou and the monitoring agreement , especially since the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would be “ keen to prove its mettle ” and would itself be subject to the vigilance of other nongovernmental organisations . xxmaj this would also prevent any real risk of the use by the xxup gid of tactics such as last - minute refusals of access , claims that the applicant did not wish to see the monitors or moving him elsewhere without notification . xxmaj access by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would also prevent the applicant ’s incommunicado detention . \n",
       "  35.the xxup mou would also counteract the climate of impunity prevailing in the xxup gid and toleration of torture by its senior members . xxmaj the xxup mou and the monitoring arrangements were supported at the highest levels in xxmaj jordan – the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan ’s political power and prestige were behind the xxup mou – so it was reasonable to assume that instructions on how to treat the applicant had been given to the xxup gid and it would be aware that any breaches would not go unpunished . xxmaj moreover , senior members of the xxup gid had participated in the xxup mou negotiations and therefore would know the consequences of any failure to comply . xxmaj even if abuses were normally the work of rogue officers , the specific and unusual position of the applicant and the effect of the xxup mou would lead to senior officers preventing ill - treatment in his case , even if they did so only out of self - interest . \n",
       "  36.questioning by the xxmaj united xxmaj states was not forbidden by the xxup mou and , to xxup siac , it was probable that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj central xxmaj intelligence xxmaj agency would be allowed to question the applicant directly with the xxup gid present . xxmaj however , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would have made clear to the xxmaj united xxmaj states its interests in ensuring that the xxup mou was not breached . xxmaj the xxmaj jordanian authorities and xxmaj united xxmaj states would be careful to ensure that the xxmaj united xxmaj states did not “ overstep the mark ” . xxmaj assuming that the applicant remained in xxup gid custody and was not surrendered to the xxmaj united xxmaj states , there would be no real risk of ill - treatment at the pre - trial stage . xxmaj it was also highly unlikely that the applicant would be placed in any secret xxup gid or xxup cia detention facility in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  37.the same factors applied to any questioning which might take place soon after the conviction or acquittal of the applicant . xxmaj the xxup mou would continue to apply and it would be in the interests of both the xxmaj jordanians and the xxmaj americans to conduct any interrogation at the earliest opportunity rather than wait until after trial . xxmaj the applicant ’s high profile was also found to be “ unlikely to diminish much for some years ” . \n",
       "  38.there was little likelihood of the xxmaj jordanian authorities bringing any subsequent charges which carried the death penalty or seeking the death penalty in respect of the charges for which the applicant was to be retried . xxmaj instead , if he were convicted , the applicant would face a lengthy period of imprisonment . xxmaj there was a real risk of a life sentence in respect of the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge conspiracy , although there was a greater prospect that it would be considerably less because of the way in which sentences on the other defendants appeared to have been reduced on appeal , to 4 or 5 years . xxmaj there was no real risk of a life sentence in the millennium conspiracy retrial . xxmaj there was no rule that would prevent a higher sentence being imposed than the 15 year sentence that had been imposed in absentia . xxmaj however , the clear practice was against imposing higher sentences in retrials following initial convictions in absentia and there was no reason why a more unfavourable view would be taken of the applicant when he was present than when he was absent . xxmaj the applicant would serve any sentence in an ordinary prison and not a xxup gid detention facility ; the sentence of hard labour did not connote any additional punishment . xxmaj general conditions would not breach xxmaj article 3 and , although beatings sometimes occurred , there was no evidence that the applicant would be targeted as a political xxmaj islamist prisoner . xxmaj his status would again act to protect him . \n",
       "  39.in respect of rendition , there were “ powerful incentives ” for the xxmaj jordanian and xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj governments not to allow this to happen , not least the real domestic political difficulties this would create for the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and the unwillingness of the xxmaj united xxmaj states to destabilise the xxmaj jordanian regime . xxmaj any instances of alleged rendition from xxmaj jordan had involved people of other nationalities or , in one case , of a dual xxup us / xxmaj jordanian national . xxmaj it was also very unlikely that the applicant would be removed to a secret xxup cia facility in xxmaj jordan since this would require the connivance of the xxmaj jordanian authorities contrary to the xxup mou . xxmaj it was also unlikely that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government would seek the extradition of the applicant from xxmaj jordan when it had not sought his extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and there would be political difficulties for xxmaj jordan to accede to such a request . \n",
       "  ( d)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 5 \n",
       "  40.in relation to the applicant ’s detention following his removal to xxmaj jordan , xxup siac found that the time limits for notifying the legal authorities of an arrest ( 48 hours ) and for bringing formal charges ( 15 days ) were regularly and lawfully extended by the courts at the request of the prosecutor , in stages of up to 15 days to a maximum of 50 days . xxmaj it would therefore be compatible with xxmaj jordanian law for the applicant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a court before being charged . xxmaj such extensions were approved by a judicial authority , although not necessarily in the physical presence of the suspect . \n",
       "  xxup 41.siac noted that the xxup mou did not explicitly require that there be no extensions of time beyond the initial 15 day detention but required that a returned person be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorised by law to determine the lawfulness of his detention . xxmaj though “ promptly ” was not defined in the xxup mou , xxup siac found that this part of the xxup mou would be carried out , particularly since this was one of the earliest points at which the xxup mou would be engaged , and that the applicant ’s first appearance before a judicial authority would be within 48 hours . xxmaj it would not breach the xxup mou if the applicant were to be detained for a maximum of 50 days , by means of judicially approved 15 day extensions , or if he were absent when those later decisions were taken . xxmaj however , in reality the total period of 50 days was unlikely to be sought , even without the xxup mou , because the applicant faced a retrial and the case dossiers had already been through the trial and appeal process a number of times . \n",
       "  ( e)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 6 \n",
       "  42.it was common ground before xxup siac that the applicant ’s previous convictions would be set aside and he would face retrial before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court on the same charges . \n",
       "  43.in addition to his two challenges to the retrial process ( the impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the use of evidence obtained by torture ) the applicant also argued that he would be questioned in detention without the presence of a lawyer by the xxup gid , xxmaj united xxmaj states officials or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the latter had the power under xxmaj article 64(3 ) of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj criminal xxmaj trial xxmaj procedures xxmaj code to conduct an investigation in the absence of a lawyer “ whenever he [ deemed ] it necessary in order to reveal the truth ” . xxmaj this decision was not subject to review , though xxup siac also noted that a confession before the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was not admissible unless the individual had been warned that he need not answer questions without his lawyer present . xxup siac thought it unlikely that the applicant would have a lawyer present during questioning by the xxup gid or xxmaj united xxmaj states officials but very likely he would have access to a lawyer for any appearance before a judge or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj in terms of pre - trial preparation by the defence , the period and facilities available would be less extensive than in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom but nonetheless better than would normally be the case in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  44.with regard to the lack of independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , xxup siac found that the court would consist of three judges , at least two of whom would be legally qualified military officers with no security of tenure . xxmaj the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor would also be a military officer . xxmaj appeal would lie to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , a civilian court , though that court could not hear argument on any unfairness of the trial arising from the military composition of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . \n",
       "  45.as to the potential use of evidence obtained by torture in the applicant ’s retrial , xxup siac found as follows : \n",
       "  “ 418.the xxmaj jordanian legal system , by its terms , does not therefore permit the use of involuntary confession or incriminatory statements . xxmaj there is a judicial examination of allegations of that nature before the evidence is admitted . xxmaj those allegations can themselves be tested by evidence . xxmaj how far those allegations can be practicably tested is affected by certain features of the system . xxmaj the burden of proof for excluding confessions made to the xxmaj prosecutor lies on the defendant . xxmaj there is obvious difficulty in proving prior acts or threats by the xxup gid in the absence of systems for recording questioning , for ensuring the presence of lawyers during questioning , and independent prompt medical examinations . xxmaj there is likely to be considerable reluctance on the part of the xxmaj court to accept that confessions to the xxmaj prosecutor , a common source of evidence , are tainted by ill - treatment . xxmaj the xxmaj court or xxmaj prosecutor does not appear prepared to compel the appearance of xxup gid officials to testify about these allegations . xxmaj there may be a sense that these allegations are made routinely , as a matter of defence strategy . \n",
       "  419.there may well be a greater willingness to test the nature of confessions made only in the course of xxup gid questioning . xxmaj there is some evidence that at least at xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation level , confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture have been excluded , ( though it is not clear whether those were made to the xxup gid or to the xxmaj prosecutor ) . \n",
       "  420.however , the general background evidence and that specific to the two trials in question shows that there is at least a very real risk that the incriminating statements against the [ applicant ] were obtained as a result of treatment by the xxup gid which breached xxmaj article 3 xxup echr ; it may or may not have amounted to torture . xxmaj it is very improbable that those statements would be excluded on the retrial , because the ssct is unlikely to be persuaded that they were so obtained , particularly having already rejected that assertion at the first trials , although the makers could give evidence that they were so obtained and were in fact untrue . ” \n",
       "  xxmaj there was , therefore , a high probability that the past statements made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor which incriminated the applicant would be admitted . xxup siac further found that those statements would be of considerable , perhaps decisive , importance against him . xxmaj on this aspect of the retrial , xxup siac held : \n",
       "  “ 439.to us , the question comes back to whether or not it is unfair for the burden of proof in xxmaj jordan to lie where it does on this issue ; we do not think that to be unfair in itself . xxmaj however , this burden of proof appears to be unaccompanied by some of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment or means of assisting its proof eg video or other recording of questioning by the xxup gid , limited periods of detention for questioning , invariable presence of lawyers , routine medical examination , assistance from the xxmaj court in calling relevant officials or doctors . xxmaj the decisions are also made by a court which lacks independence and does not appear to examine closely or vigorously allegations of this nature . xxmaj it is taking these points in combination which leads us to conclude that the trial would be likely to be unfair within xxmaj article 6 because of the way the allegations about involuntary statements would be considered . ” \n",
       "  xxup 46.siac concluded that , despite its findings in respect of the independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 , there would be no flagrant denial of justice under xxmaj article 6 of the xxmaj convention if the applicant were retried in xxmaj jordan . xxup siac stated that the retrial would take place “ within a legally constructed framework covering the court system , the procedural rules and the offences ” , the applicant would be present and it would be in public . xxmaj the dossier from the original trial would be before the retrial court but the applicant could effectively challenge its contents . xxmaj the execution of xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine and the difficulty faced by other witnesses , notably xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , would not make the retrial unfair . xxup siac concluded : \n",
       "  “ 446.we accept the lack of institutional independence in the ssct . xxmaj the lack of independence for ssct xxmaj judges is in the structure and system . xxmaj there is no evidence as to why particular judges might be chosen for particular cases , or that they are ‘ leaned on’ . xxmaj but the ssct is not a mere tool of the executive : there is sound evidence that it appraises the evidence and tests it against the law , and acquits a number of defendants . xxmaj it has reduced sentences over time . \n",
       "  447.its judges have legal training and are career military lawyers . xxmaj there is a very limited basis beyond that for saying that they would be partial , and that has not been the gravamen of the complaint . xxmaj their background may well make them sceptical about allegations of abuse by the xxup gid affecting statements made to the xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj they may instinctively share the view that allegations of ill - treatment are a routine part of a defence case to excuse the incrimination of others . xxmaj the legal framework is poorly geared to detecting and acting upon allegations of abuse . xxmaj the way in which it approaches the admission of evidence , on the material we have , shows no careful scrutiny of potentially tainted evidence . xxmaj there would be considerable publicity given to the retrial and public trials can encourage greater care and impartiality in the examination of the evidence . xxmaj this would not be a mere show trial , nor were the first trials ; nor would the result be a foregone conclusion , regardless of the evidence . \n",
       "  448.reasons are given for the decisions , and an appeal to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation is available . xxmaj the fact that such an appeal can not cure the want of structural independence in the ssct is not a reason for discounting its existence in the overall assessment of whether there would be a complete denial of xxmaj article 6 rights . xxmaj this xxmaj court is a civilian court and the evidence of undue executive influence through appointment or removal is quite sparse . xxmaj there is no evidence again as to how its panels are chosen , nor that they are “ leaned on ” by the executive . xxmaj it plainly operates as a corrective to the rulings of the ssct on law and procedure , and is of some relevance to factual matters , even though it does not hear the evidence all over again or have a full factual jurisdiction except on xxmaj prosecutors’ appeals . xxmaj the probable sentences are not wholly disproportionate to the offences . \n",
       "  449.we have discussed at length the approach of the ssct to the admission of statements to a prosecutor allegedly given as a result of prior ill - treatment . xxmaj although we take the view that a contribution of factors would probably make the retrial unfair in that respect , they do not constitute a complete denial of a fair trial . xxmaj the existence of a legal prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence can not be ignored , nor the fact that the ssct would hear evidence relating to the allegations . xxmaj the role of the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation in reviewing and at times overturning the conclusions of the ssct on this issue is material . xxmaj the want of evidential or procedural safeguards to balance the burden of proof , and the probable cast of mind towards statements made to a prosecutor / judge in a civil law system , all within a security court dominated by military lawyers , does not suffice for a complete denial of justice . \n",
       "  450.there is a danger , given the inevitable focus on what is said to be potentially unfair about the retrial , in focussing exclusively on deficiencies when deciding whether there would be a total denial of the right to a fair trial , rather than looking at the picture of the trial as a whole . xxmaj that is what has to be done however and it is that picture as a whole which has led us to our conclusion on this issue . \n",
       "  451.the various factors which would be likely to cause the retrial to breach xxmaj article 6 are to a considerable degree interlinked . xxmaj taking them in the round does not persuade us that there is a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial . ” \n",
       "  47.finally , while there was the real prospect of a long term of imprisonment , this did not alter xxup siac ’s conclusion that the overall nature of the retrial would not be a total denial of the applicant ’s rights . \n",
       "  2.proceedings before the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal \n",
       "  48.the applicant appealed to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , which gave judgment on 9 xxmaj april 2008 , unanimously allowing the appeal in respect of xxmaj article 6 and the risk of the use of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 and dismissing it on all other grounds ( [ 2008 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 290 ) . \n",
       "  49.for the applicant ’s complaints under xxmaj article 3 as to the use of closed evidence by xxup siac and the reliance on the assurances in the xxup mou , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal considered it was bound by its previous ruling on these questions in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb ( xxmaj algeria ) , u ( xxmaj algeria ) v. the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department [ 2007 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 808 , which had found that : ( i ) xxup siac could consider closed evidence on safety on return ; and ( ii ) the relevance of assurances to safety on return was a matter of fact not law and thus it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on that ground . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also rejected the applicant ’s appeals based on xxmaj article 5 , finding that xxup siac was entitled to find as it did . \n",
       "  50.for xxmaj article 6 , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal rejected the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk of a “ flagrant denial of justice ” in his retrial in xxmaj jordan by reason of a lack of independence and or impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court : xxup siac had been entitled to find as it did on this point and this conclusion was not altered by the later decision of this xxmaj court in almoayad v. xxmaj germany ( dec . ) , no . 35865 / 03 , 20 xxmaj february 2007 . \n",
       "  51.however , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal accepted the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk that he would suffer a “ flagrant denial of justice ” by reason of the risk that statements obtained through treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 would be admitted as evidence against him in his retrial . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed : \n",
       "  “ xxup 45.siac understated or misunderstood the fundamental nature in xxmaj convention law of the prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by torture . xxmaj counsel for the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state said that it was no part of his submission to say that if it is clear that a trial will take place on the basis of evidence obtained under torture , whether of the individual themselves , or third parties , that that would not involve flagrant denial of justice . xxmaj accordingly , once xxup siac had found as a fact that there was a high probability that evidence that may very well have been obtained by torture ( xxup siac , 436 ) ; or in respect of which there was a very real risk that it had been obtained by torture or other conduct breaching article 3 ( xxup siac , 437 ) ; would be admitted at the trial of mrothman ; then xxup siac had to be satisfied that such evidence would be excluded or not acted on . xxmaj the grounds relied on by xxup siac for not finding a threatened breach of article 6 in that respect were insufficient . \n",
       "  46.we emphasise that that is not or not primarily a criticism of xxup siac ’s reasoning in terms of rationality , though we do consider additionally that xxup siac ’s conclusions did not follow rationally from its findings of fact . xxmaj rather , our principal finding is that xxup siac erred by applying an insufficiently demanding test to determine the issue of whether article 6 rights would be breached . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  48.the use of evidence obtained by torture is prohibited in xxmaj convention law not just because that will make the trial unfair , but also and more particularly because of the connexion of the issue with article 3 , a fundamental , unconditional and non - derogable prohibition that stands at the centre of the xxmaj convention protections . xxmaj as the ecthr put it in 105 of its judgment in xxmaj jalloh v xxmaj germany 44 xxup ehrr 32 : \n",
       "  ‘ incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture - should never be relied on as proof of the victim ’s guilt , irrespective of its probative value . xxmaj any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of xxmaj art.3 of the xxmaj convention sought to proscribe or , as it was so well put in the xxup us xxmaj supreme xxmaj court ’s judgment in the xxmaj rochin case 342 xxup us 165 , “ to afford brutality the cloak of law”.’ \n",
       "  xxmaj that view , that the use of evidence obtained by torture or ill - treatment is prohibited not just , or indeed primarily , because of its likely unreliability , but rather because the state must stand firm against the conduct that has produced the evidence , is universally recognised both within and outside xxmaj convention law . \n",
       "  xxmaj what is , with respect , a particularly strong statement to that effect , citing a multitude of equally strongly worded authorities , is to be found in 17 of the speech of xxmaj lord xxmaj bingham in a v xxmaj home xxmaj secretary ( xxmaj no2 ) [ 2006 ] 2 xxup ac 221 . \n",
       "  xxup 49.siac was wrong not to recognise this crucial difference between breaches of article 6 based on this ground and breaches of article 6 based simply on defects in the trial process or in the composition of the court . xxmaj rather , in its conclusions in 442452 of its determination ... it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the independence of the court : see in particular xxup siac at 449 - 450 . xxmaj that caused it not to recognise the high degree of assurance that is required in relation to proceedings in a foreign state before a person may lawfully be deported to face a trial that may involve evidence obtained by torture . ” \n",
       "  52.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal noted that xxup siac had reached its conclusion that there would not be a complete denial of justice in relation to the use of evidence obtained by torture by relying on the process , admittedly not wholly satisfactory , before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation . xxmaj for the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal that conclusion sat very ill with xxup siac ’s own findings about the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court process , in particular xxup siac ’s own concern as to the difficulties in proving that evidence had been obtained by torture . xxmaj in the opinion of the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , xxup siac ’s concern was “ amply justified by the litany of lack of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment ” in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj it also criticised xxup siac ’s “ disturbing failure ” to give proper weight to the findings as to the defects in the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj it was not open to xxup siac to conclude on that evidence that the risk of the total denial of justice that is represented by the use of evidence obtained by torture had been adequately excluded . xxup siac could not have so concluded if it had properly understood the status in xxmaj convention law of this aspect of article 6 . ” \n",
       "  3.proceedings before the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords \n",
       "  53.the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state appealed to the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords in relation to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal ’s conclusion on xxmaj article 6 . xxmaj the applicant cross - appealed in relation to his other xxmaj convention complaints . xxmaj the appeal was heard with the appeals of two of the appellants in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb and u ( see paragraph 48 above ) . xxmaj in the conjoined appeals the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords was therefore able to consider the use of closed material before xxup siac , the reliance on the assurances contained in the xxup mou and the applicant ’s xxmaj articles5 and 6 complaints . xxmaj the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords gave judgment on 18february 2009 unanimously allowing the xxmaj government ’s appeal and dismissing the applicant ’s cross - appeal ( [ 2009 ] xxup ukhl 10 ) . \n",
       "  ( a)article 3 : the “ closed ” proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  54.lord xxmaj phillips held that xxup siac was lawfully entitled to consider closed material in evaluating safety on return and there were cogent considerations of policy for doing so . a distinction had to be drawn between closed material on safety on return and the use of closed material in other proceedings , for example to establish the national security threat posed by an individual . xxmaj for the former , the individual would normally be aware of the nature of any risk on return and , in any event , it was for the individual himself , and not the xxmaj state , to make out his case on whether he would be at risk on return . xxmaj it was not likely to be critically important for a special advocate to be able to obtain input from the person to be deported in relation to closed evidence . xxmaj as regards the impracticality of obtaining an appropriate expert witness with security clearance to see the material , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips did not regard the problem as unfair . xxup siac ’s rules of procedure enabled the special advocate to ask xxup siac to call for more evidence and xxup siac , as an expert tribunal , could be relied upon “ to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate ’s submission ” . xxmaj in respect of the assurances , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips endorsed the view that the assurances contained in the xxup mou had to be disclosed but details of the negotiations leading to the xxup mou could be closed material . \n",
       "  55.lord xxmaj hoffmann rejected the applicant ’s argument on the more fundamental basis that he viewed this xxmaj court ’s case - law as making it clear that the determination whether a deportation order might infringe xxmaj article 3 did not require “ the full judicial panoply of article 6 or even 5(4 ) ” . xxmaj citing xxmaj chahal , cited above , he emphasised that all that was required was “ independent scrutiny of the claim ” , which had occurred in the applicant ’s case . \n",
       "  56.lord xxmaj hope agreed , albeit accepting that this xxmaj court had not yet had the opportunity to analyse whether the xxup siac system met the requirements of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj in his view , it did so . xxmaj lord xxmaj brown also agreed , emphasising that with regard to safety on return , no case was being made against the applicant ; rather it was he who was making a case against the returning xxmaj state . \n",
       "  ( b)article 3 : assurances and the xxup mou \n",
       "  57.lord xxmaj phillips ( with whom the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords agreed ) construed the this xxmaj court ’s case - law from xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , onwards as treating assurances “ as part of the matrix that had to be considered ” when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would face treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj he referred to the “ abundance ” of international law material , which supported the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by xxmaj state agents was endemic . xxmaj however , for xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips this came “ close to a ‘ xxmaj catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you can not rely on them ” . xxmaj in rejecting that proposition , he held that the only basis to interfere with the view of xxup siac was if its conclusions that the assurances could be relied upon were irrational and xxup siac ’s conclusions in the present case were not . \n",
       "  ( c)article 5 \n",
       "  58.the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords unanimously refused to interfere with the finding of fact by xxup siac that the applicant ’s exposure under xxmaj jordanian law to 50 days’ detention without access to a court or a lawyer , would not arise . xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found that , even if it would arise , 50 days’ detention would not constitute a flagrant breach of xxmaj article 5 . a flagrant breach was a breach whose consequences were so severe that they overrode the right of a xxmaj state to expel an alien from its territory . xxmaj that might be satisfied by arbitrary detention which lasted many years but not 50 days’ detention . \n",
       "  ( d)article 6 \n",
       "  59.on xxmaj article 6 , taking the test to be whether there would be a “ complete denial or nullification ” of the right to a fair trial , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips observed : \n",
       "  “ 136.this is neither an easy nor an adequate test of whether article 6 should bar the deportation of an alien . xxmaj in the first place it is not easy to postulate what amounts to ‘ a complete denial or nullification of the right to a fair trial’ . xxmaj that phrase can not require that every aspect of the trial process should be unfair . ... xxmaj what is required is that the deficiency or deficiencies in the trial process should be such as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of the prospective trial . \n",
       "  137.in the second place , the fact that the deportee may find himself subject in the receiving country to a legal process that is blatantly unfair can not , of itself , justify placing an embargo on his deportation . xxmaj the focus must be not simply on the unfairness of the trial process but on its potential consequences . xxmaj an unfair trial is likely to lead to the violation of substantive human rights and the extent of that prospective violation must plainly be an important factor in deciding whether deportation is precluded . ” \n",
       "  60.having reviewed , the relevant case - law of this xxmaj court , including xxmaj bader and xxmaj kanbor v. xxmaj sweden , no . 13284 / 04 , 42 , xxup echr xxup 2005xi , which he took to exemplify the need to consider the risk of a violation of xxmaj article 6 in combination with other xxmaj articles such as xxmaj articles 2 and 3 , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he xxmaj strasbourg jurisprudence , tentative though it is , has led me to these conclusions . xxmaj before the deportation of an alien will be capable of violating article 6 there must be substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk ( i ) that there will be a fundamental breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 and ( ii ) that this failure will lead to a miscarriage of justice that itself constitutes a flagrant violation of the victim ’s fundamental rights . ” \n",
       "  61.in the present case , the second limb was met by the potential sentences of imprisonment the applicant faced . xxmaj for the first limb , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips concluded that , although the military constitution of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court would render the trial contrary to xxmaj article 6 if it were held in a xxmaj convention xxmaj state , he agreed with xxup siac and the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , that it could not amount to a “ flagrant denial of justice ” sufficient to prevent deportation in a removal case . \n",
       "  62.in respect of the applicant ’s complaint that there was a real risk that the evidence against him had been obtained by torture , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips held that the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal erred . xxmaj it had required too high a degree of assurance that evidence that might have been obtained by torture would not be used in a foreign trial . xxmaj he stated : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he prohibition on receiving evidence obtained by torture is not primarily because such evidence is unreliable or because the reception of the evidence will make the trial unfair . xxmaj rather it is because ‘ the state must stand firm against the conduct that produced the evidence’ . xxmaj that principle applies to the state in which an attempt is made to adduce such evidence . xxmaj it does not require this state , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , to retain in this country to the detriment of national security a terrorist suspect unless it has a high degree of assurance that evidence obtained by torture will not be adduced against him in xxmaj jordan ... xxmaj the issue before xxup siac was whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that if xxmaj mr xxmaj othman were deported to xxmaj jordan the criminal trial that he would there face would have defects of such significance as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of his trial or , as xxup siac put it , to amount to a total denial of the right to a fair trial . xxup siac concluded that the deficiencies that xxup siac had identified did not meet that exacting test . i do not find that in reaching this conclusion xxup siac erred in law . ” \n",
       "  63.lord xxmaj hoffmann found that there was no xxmaj convention authority for the rule that , in the context of the application of xxmaj article 6 to a removal case , the risk of the use of evidence obtained by torture necessarily amounted to a flagrant denial of justice . \n",
       "  64.lord xxmaj hope agreed . xxmaj he accepted that this xxmaj court had adopted an “ uncompromising approach ” to the use at trial of evidence obtained by torture but the evidence before xxup siac did not come up to that standard . xxmaj there were allegations but no proof . xxmaj the assertion that there was a real risk that the evidence was obtained by torture was not enough to prohibit removal . xxmaj he recalled xxup siac ’s findings that the retrial would probably not comply with xxmaj article 6 if xxmaj jordan were a party to the xxmaj convention but would take place within a legally constructed framework . xxmaj there was sound evidence that the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , which was not a mere tool of the executive , appraised the evidence and tested it against the law . xxup siac had therefore been entitled to find as it did on the evidence . \n",
       "  65.lord xxmaj brown agreed with xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips and , referring to the majority of the xxmaj grand xxmaj chamber in xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , stated : “ if extradition was not unlawful even in the circumstances arising there , in my judgment expulsion most certainly is not unlawful here . ” \n",
       "  66.lord xxmaj mance , who agreed with the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords on xxmaj article 6 and all other points of appeal , noted a considerable resemblance between the concept of “ flagrant unfairness ” in this xxmaj court ’s case - law and the concept of denial of justice in public international law generally . xxmaj for the latter , the modern consensus was that the factual circumstances had to be egregious for xxmaj state responsibility to arise in international law . \n",

       "  9 . xxmaj when the applicant was still single he lived with his parents . xxmaj since his marriage he has lived in a house rented by his parents - in - law . xxmaj one of his wife 's brothers and two of her aunts have also lived there at various times in that period . xxmaj the house , in xxmaj funchal ( xxmaj madeira ) , has four bedrooms , a kitchen , a living - cum - dining room and a basement . \n",
       "  10 . xxmaj in xxmaj november 1982 xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto inherited from his parents a house also situated in xxmaj funchal . xxmaj this house , which has been let for residential use to xxup e.r. since 23 xxmaj june 1964 , has three bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom . xxmaj the rent , which had initially been fixed at 1,200 escudos ( xxup pte ) , was xxup pte 1,500 at the time when the proceedings began . \n",
       "  11 . xxmaj on 6 xxmaj april 1983 the applicant and his wife brought proceedings against xxup e.r. and his wife in the xxmaj funchal xxmaj court of xxmaj first xxmaj instance . xxmaj relying on xxmaj articles 1096 and 1098 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , they asked the court to terminate the lease on the ground that they needed to occupy the property as their own home . \n",
       "  12 . xxmaj the xxmaj funchal xxmaj court of xxmaj first xxmaj instance found against the applicant and his wife on 13 xxmaj march 1989 . xxmaj it held that one of the statutory requirements for termination had not been satisfied , since the applicant had not established facts which proved a real need to occupy the house himself . \n",
       "  xxmaj the reasons given by the judge included the following considerations : \n",
       "  \" a landlord 's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances , his living conditions and / or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future . \n",
       "  xxmaj in that connection , the following facts have already been established : that ' since his marriage , in xxmaj april 1979 , xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto has lived with his parents - in - law in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , [ xxmaj funchal ] ' ; that ' xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , one of xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's brothers and two of her aunts ... lived in the house ' ; that ' the plaintiffs ' house has three bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom ' ; that ' the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ' ; that ' xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents - in - law , who are at present the sole occupants , with xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , of the house in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' ; and that ' the plaintiffs both work in xxmaj funchal ' . \n",
       "  xxmaj it should be noted that xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need . xxmaj the plaintiffs ' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought , since they even have a bedroom for their son . \n",
       "  xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving , as the onus was on them to do , that the relations between themselves and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents were permanently strained and conflictual . xxmaj what is certain , however , is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son 's illness and their living conditions in that house . \n",
       "  xxmaj it might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with xxunk xxmaj barreto 's parents , ' who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' - that in view of the xxunk ' xxmaj when a man marries he needs a house ' , cited by xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto in his first application , the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  xxmaj however , each case is unique . xxmaj regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims , but not established , and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity , to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion , in the light of everyday experience , it can not be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there . \n",
       "  xxmaj their living conditions would certainly be better and more comfortable in the house let to the defendants , but the real need required by case - law does not exist , nor is this a case where it is absolutely necessary or essential for the plaintiffs to recover possession of the accommodation . \n",
       "  xxmaj it follows that , although the other conditions in xxmaj article 1098 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code have been satisfied , the plaintiffs ' application must be considered inadmissible , since they have not established that they are entitled to terminate the lease under xxmaj article 1096 para . 1 ( a ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj in conclusion , without finding it necessary to add any further considerations , i declare unfounded , for lack of evidence , the present action for termination of the lease and eviction of the tenant ( processo especial de xxunk ) , and find against the plaintiffs ... \" \n",
       "  13 . xxmaj on 6 xxmaj april 1989 xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto appealed against this judgment to the xxmaj lisbon xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal . xxmaj referring to the underlying intention of the legislation concerning the right to terminate a lease , he argued that he and his family had the right to live in a home they did not have to share with anyone . \n",
       "  14 . xxmaj on 11 xxmaj october 1990 the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal upheld the impugned judgment . xxmaj it held that the house of the applicant 's parents - in - law was large enough for all the people who lived in it , including the applicant , his wife and his son . xxmaj there was therefore no real need for xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto to live in the house he owned . \n",
       "  xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal gave the following reasons for its decision : \n",
       "  \" xxmaj in order to establish need , plaintiffs must cite specific facts which , once proved , establish the existence of a real , serious and present need , adducing weighty rather than purely hypothetical arguments . xxmaj it is not sufficient to desire , to wish or to claim . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  xxmaj in order to be able to exercise their right [ to terminate the lease ] , the applicants must adduce evidence of those facts ( xxmaj article 342 para . 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ) . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  ... it is established that : \n",
       "  ( a ) the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ; \n",
       "  ( b ) at present that house is occupied by xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents - in - law , the plaintiffs and their son , that is five people altogether ; and \n",
       "  ( c ) xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents - in - law are resigned to the presence in the house of the plaintiffs and their son . \n",
       "  xxmaj as the house has four bedrooms , the plaintiffs can occupy one room and their son another . \n",
       "  xxmaj the house has enough bedrooms for all the members of the family to be able to live there . \n",
       "  xxmaj each couple has a bedroom and the plaintiffs ' son has his . xxmaj and there is still one bedroom left over . \n",
       "  xxmaj the judgment must reflect the situation at the conclusion of the evidence and argument ( xxmaj article 663 para . 1 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation , the fact that they live with xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , albeit by their favour , is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by xxmaj article 1096 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ... xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house . \n",
       "  xxmaj derogation from the general principle and eviction of the tenant for the benefit of the landlord are possible only where it appears to be absolutely necessary , for weighty reasons , for the landlord to live in the property ( xxmaj article 1095 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ) . \n",
       "  xxmaj in the light of the foregoing considerations , and because the plaintiffs have not proved need as set out above and as this court interprets it , the appeal is inadmissible and the judgment is upheld . \" \n",

       "  20.the child ’s biological father , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk , intervened in the proceedings . \n",
       "  21.in a judgment of 31 xxmaj october 2002 the court dismissed the applicant ’s claims , holding as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj in support of her application for the annulment of the decision to give up the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 and for the child ’s return , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk alleges that an error was committed as to the meaning and scope of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national living and working in xxmaj dublin , came to the maternity ward in xxmaj xxunk to give birth on 18 xxmaj february 2002 . xxmaj on that occasion she expressed the wish for her admission and her identity to be kept secret . \n",
       "  xxmaj the exercise by any woman of this right , which is enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , is governed by the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 222 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code , as amended by the xxmaj act of 22 xxmaj january 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj it appears from the evidence before the court ... that at least two lengthy interviews were held in order to explain to this woman the conditions and effects of anonymous registration of a birth . xxmaj these interviews took place in the presence of xxmaj english speakers , and xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , who chose to come to xxmaj france to give birth , can not expect the social services to have offered anything more in this respect , particularly not the presence of an official interpreter , which is not provided for or required by any statutory instrument . xxmaj furthermore , it appears from the proceedings ... and from the written submissions summarising her counsel ’s address ... that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was taken to hospital by a lawyer ; she had therefore clearly sought legal advice prior to the birth . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , no matter what psychological state the applicant may have been in , like any woman opting to give birth in these circumstances , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was nevertheless fully aware of both the immediate and the future implications of her actions and decisions . xxmaj she thus acted quite consciously in having the birth registered anonymously and giving the child up to the social services to be taken into xxmaj state care , and there are no grounds for arguing that her intellectual faculties were impaired or that the consent was invalid in any way ; moreover , the question of consent is not applicable from a civil - status perspective . \n",
       "  xxmaj in addition , as regards the formal propriety of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , once a child is entrusted to the social services , the latter assume a number of obligations , including the provision of information ... xxmaj it appears from the record of the child ’s placement , which contains entries whose existence is not disputed , that the social services fulfilled their obligation to provide information on a child ’s placement in xxmaj state care and the ensuing legal effects . xxmaj such information was , moreover , provided in xxmaj english , and the notice and model letter requesting the return of the child were indeed given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk fully understood the meaning and scope of this information since she left documents for the child in the event that the latter expressed the wish to discover her origins at a future date . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk clearly expressed her wish that the child should never be able to have legal ties to her . xxmaj moreover , she did not withdraw her consent within the two - month period . xxmaj it should be noted in this connection that this right is strictly personal ; accordingly , no action by a third person may be treated as an action to withdraw consent , that being the sole prerogative of the mother , or interrupt the relevant period . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , there are no grounds for declaring null and void the record of 19february 2002 , which served as an entirely valid basis for the placement in xxmaj state care ( first provisionally and later with final effect ) of the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 with no established parentage ... \n",
       "  xxmaj since the mother did not apply for the return of the child within two months after giving her up , the child , who has no legally established parentage , was able to be placed with foster parents by the xxmaj state authorities with a view to her adoption under xxmaj article 351 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj such placement for adoption , by virtue of the provisions of xxmaj article 352 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , constitutes a bar not only to the return of the child to the mother but also to any declaration of filiation or recognition . xxmaj the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared ineffective . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk further alleges a violation of xxmaj articles 13 and 14 of the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights . \n",
       "  xxmaj as stated above , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk gave birth ... while wishing to keep the birth and her identity secret , a right enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and given effect by the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj more generally , these xxmaj articles govern the conditions for giving up a child , for consent to adoption or for anonymous registration of a birth , as well as the conditions and procedures applicable in the event of repudiation and / or withdrawal of any of these measures . \n",
       "  xxmaj they strike a delicate balance between the rights of a mother , which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , to give birth anonymously with the consequences that entails , and the rights of the foster parents and of the child , whose rights are now framed in such a way as to allow him or her access to more information , if he or she so desires , but in whose interests stability and certainty , both psychological and legal , must be sought , if only through the shortness of the time within which the natural parents may avail themselves of the appropriate procedures . \n",
       "  xxmaj the instant case thus can not be said to involve any discrimination or deprivation of the enjoyment of a right secured to the mother or the child by the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights , or indeed our national law , within the meaning of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj similarly , no matter how short they are , time - limits do exist in xxmaj french law for bringing an action in the ordinary courts , constituting , within the meaning of xxmaj article 13 of the xxmaj convention ... , an effective remedy before a national authority independent of the administrative authority that may be required to rule on an application for the return of a child or to approve an adoption . ” \n",
       "  22.the applicant appealed . xxmaj in a judgment of 22 xxmaj september 2003 the xxmaj douai xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal set aside the first - instance judgment . xxmaj after reiterating the content of the record of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , and in particular the information it provided , the court held : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj paragraph 3 of the section on information thus expressly mentions the existence of two time - limits for the child ’s return without any further formalities , one being two months ( the only possible limit that could apply in the instant case ) , the other being six months , where the second parent has not entrusted the child to the social services . \n",
       "  xxmaj this six - month time - limit is mentioned on two further occasions , firstly in relation to the right to have the child returned to the second parent and secondly in indicating that even after the expiry of the two - month and six - month periods , a court action may still be brought . \n",
       "  xxmaj this information could have misled xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... since in reality the six - month time - limit applicable under xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code in the circumstances referred to in xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 did not apply in the instant case , there being no established paternity as the mother had registered the birth anonymously , and the placement therefore came under point ( 1 ) of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national who is a native xxmaj english speaker and does not speak xxmaj french , could not have known the consequences in xxmaj french law of anonymous registration of the birth , in terms of her rights and those of the biological father , and the information given was in no way capable of xxunk her in a clear and precise manner . \n",
       "  xxmaj having been informed of the existence of a six - month time - limit where ‘ the child has a second parent who did not entrust him or her to the service’ , she may legitimately have thought , in the light of the information set out in the record , that this time - limit was applicable in her case since she had on several occasions notified the local health and social services department of the existence of a biological father who had not been informed of the placement procedure . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will be observed that there is no mention in the record that an interpreter was present when it was signed and that it has not been disputed that a member of the maternity ward staff assisted with the translation and the explanation in xxmaj english of the information given in xxmaj french to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... xxmaj however , a translation of this nature , which was provided by a person who used xxmaj english only occasionally and did not have specific legal knowledge , and which , moreover , was based on particularly ambiguous information as to the time - limits , did not enable xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... to have access to proper information about her rights regarding the procedures for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj it therefore appears that the information provided to the appellant concerning the right to have the child returned was inaccurate or at least particularly ambiguous , and was set out in a pre - printed document not specially adapted to the procedure of anonymous birth registration but designed for use in any of the circumstances covered by xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code for the taking of a child into xxmaj state care ; that reference was made to a six - month time - limit not applicable in her case ; and that , moreover , being an native xxmaj english speaker , the mother was not effectively informed of the procedures for the return of her child and of the strict two - month time - limit that applied in her case . \n",
       "  xxmaj furthermore , it has not been shown in any way that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... otherwise received any clear information before the record was signed as to her right to recover the child . \n",
       "  xxmaj the note by xxmaj ms xxup f. – who also drew up the record in issue – besides having no evidential value , since it was written by a party to the proceedings , does not contain any clarification as to the information given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... about the time - limit for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , the fact that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... was in contact with a xxmaj french lawyer prior to the birth does not mean that she received precise information from him about the exclusive nature of the two - month time - limit ... \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk belief ... in the possibility of recovering the child within a six - month period is corroborated by the request she made in person on 25 and 26 xxmaj july 2002 to the xxmaj nord health and social services department , citing this time - limit , and by the subsequent letters from her lawyer , which also state that his client thought that she could take her child back within such a period . \n",
       "  xxmaj having regard to all these considerations , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... placed her child in xxmaj state care while believing – legitimately , in view of the ambiguous information she had received when signing the record of the placement – that she could take her back within a period of six months and that this time - limit also applied to xxmaj mr xxup b. , who had , moreover , instituted proceedings in xxmaj ireland on 9april 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj this error as to the time - limit for the return of the child concerns a significant element of her consent to the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care , especially as the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 5 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code require precise information on the subject to be given to the mother . \n",
       "  xxmaj in these circumstances , the application for the record of the child ’s placement of 19february 2002 to be declared null and void must be allowed . \n",
       "  ... seeing that the handing over of the child to the xxmaj state authorities was rendered void by a lack of true consent affecting the validity of the record drawn up on 19february 2002 , the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care is to be retrospectively annulled and can not therefore have any legal effect . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , the application for the child to be returned to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... should be allowed , without there being any need to address the subsidiary arguments she submitted in support of that application . \n",
       "  xxmaj pursuant to xxmaj article 334 - 8 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , parental ties shall be established between xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... and the child to whom she gave birth in the maternity ward of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj hospital on 18 xxmaj february 2002 and a reference to this judgment shall be entered in the register of births , deaths and marriages for the town of xxmaj xxunk . ” \n",
       "  23.in a letter of 24 xxmaj september 2003 the applicant ’s lawyer asked the prefect to enforce the judgment and to return the child to her mother . xxmaj no action was taken on this request . \n",
       "  24.the prefect for the dpartement of xxmaj nord appealed on points of law , arguing that in the absence of recognition by the mother of the child to whom she had given birth anonymously , it was not necessary to obtain her consent for the child to be taken into xxmaj state care . \n",
       "  25.in a judgment of 6 xxmaj april 2004 the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation allowed the appeal , holding as follows : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 , point ( 1 ) , of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code ] provides that children whose parentage has not been established or is unknown and who have been entrusted to the xxmaj child xxmaj welfare xxmaj service for more than two months are deemed to have been taken into xxmaj state care . \n",
       "  xxmaj on 18 xxmaj february 2002 xxmaj mrs xxup t. ( ne xxmaj xxunk ) gave birth anonymously . xxmaj on 19 xxmaj february 2002 a record of the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care with the xxmaj child xxmaj welfare xxmaj service was drawn up in accordance with xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 5 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code . xxmaj on 7 xxmaj may 2002 the child was placed for adoption after the xxmaj family xxmaj council for xxmaj children in xxmaj state xxmaj care had given its approval on 25 xxmaj april 2002 . xxmaj on 25 xxmaj july 2002 xxunk unsuccessfully sought to have the child returned to her . xxmaj in applications of 22august and 10september 2002 she brought proceedings against the prefect of the dpartement of xxmaj nord , seeking the return of the child . \n",
       "  xxmaj in allowing her claim , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal held that the child ’s placement with the xxmaj state authorities was rendered void by a lack of true consent affecting the validity of the record drawn up on 19 xxmaj february 2002 , seeing that when the record was signed xxunk had received only ambiguous information about the period within which she could take her child back . \n",
       "  xxmaj in so holding , despite the fact that in the absence of recognition , the child ’s parentage was not established , such that xxmaj mrs xxup t. ’s consent was not required when the child was taken into care ... , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal breached the provision cited above . ” \n",

       "  8.the applicant was convicted on 21 xxmaj february 2007 , at the age of twenty , of two counts of possession of xxmaj class a drugs with intent to supply . xxmaj he pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in 2005 , in which the applicant had been shot . xxmaj he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment , and on 18october 2007 was notified of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s intention to deport him . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom since the age of three . xxmaj his aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at the age of five , and the first official record of his presence was when he was eight years old . xxmaj even allowing for his long stay in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , only four years had been with valid leave . xxmaj it was believed that he was in contact with his mother , who remained in xxmaj nigeria , and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority , the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances . xxmaj it was not accepted that he had family life in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",

       "  21.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test . xxmaj it required firstly , that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity . xxmaj secondly , there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj the court also found , thirdly , that because of the “ foreign ” nature of expulsion cases , the threshold for what would meet the threshold of xxmaj article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving xxmaj state but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness . xxmaj fourthly , a risk of suicide could , in principle , form the basis of a successful claim under xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj fifthly , an important factor in determining whether removal would breach xxmaj article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill - treatment in the receiving xxmaj state , if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide , was objectively well - founded . a fear found not to be objectively well - founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj finally , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and / or receiving xxmaj states had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide . xxmaj the existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of xxmaj article 3 as a result of removal . \n",
       "  22.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages , namely , in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , in transit , and in the receiving xxmaj state . xxmaj the threshold for xxmaj article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving xxmaj state was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in the case of the particular appellant , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal found that the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities ; that the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state would provide appropriately qualified xxunk and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport ; and that in light of the finding that the applicant ’s fears of return to xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka were not objectively well - founded , and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that xxmaj state , the risk of suicide in xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka would not reach the very high threshold of xxmaj article 3 . \n",

       "  a.introduction \n",
       "  7.the applicant was born in 1960 near xxmaj bethlehem , then administered as part of the xxmaj kingdom of xxmaj jordan . xxmaj he arrived in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom in xxmaj september 1993 , having previously fled xxmaj jordan and gone to xxmaj pakistan . xxmaj he made a successful application for asylum , the basis of which was first , that he had been detained and tortured in xxmaj march 1988 and 1990 - 1991 by the xxmaj jordanian authorities and second , that he had been detained and later placed under house arrest on two further occasions . xxmaj the applicant was recognised as a refugee on 30 xxmaj june 1994 and granted leave to remain until 30june 1998 . xxmaj as is the normal practice , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state did not give reasons for his decision for recognising the applicant as a refugee . \n",
       "  8.on 8 xxmaj may 1998 the applicant applied for indefinite leave to remain in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj this application had not been determined before the applicant ’s arrest on 23 xxmaj october 2002 . xxmaj on that date he was taken into detention under the xxmaj anti - terrorism , xxmaj crime and xxmaj security xxmaj act 2001 ( see xxmaj a.and xxmaj others v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom [ xxup gc ] , no . 3455 / 05 , 90 , 19 xxmaj february 2009 ) . xxmaj when that xxmaj act was repealed in xxmaj march 2005 , the applicant was released on bail and then made subject to a control order under the xxmaj prevention of xxmaj terrorism xxmaj act 2005 ( ibid . , 83 and 84 ) . xxmaj on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , while his appeal against that control order was still pending , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with a notice of intention to deport ( see section 3 , paragraph 25 below ) . \n",
       "  b.previous criminal proceedings in xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  1.the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge xxmaj trial \n",
       "  9.in xxmaj april 1999 , the applicant was convicted in absentia in xxmaj jordan of conspiracy to cause explosions , in a trial known as the “ reform and challenge ” case . xxmaj he was the twelfth of thirteen defendants . \n",
       "  10.the case involved an allegation of a conspiracy to carry out bombings in xxmaj jordan , which resulted in successful attacks on the xxmaj american xxmaj school and the xxmaj jerusalem xxmaj hotel in xxmaj amman in 1998 . xxmaj there were further convictions for offences of membership of a terrorist group , but these matters were the subject of a general amnesty . xxmaj the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the conclusion of the trial . \n",
       "  11.during the trial , one witness , xxmaj mohamed xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine , confessed that he and not the defendants had been involved in the bombings . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court hearing the case took the view that his confession was false , and demonstrably so , because of discrepancies between what he said about the nature of the explosives , for example , and other technical evidence . mral - xxmaj jeramaine was later executed for homicides for which he had been convicted in another trial . \n",
       "  12.the applicant maintains that the evidence against him was predominantly based upon an incriminating statement from a co - defendant , xxmaj abdul xxmaj nasser xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher ( also known as xxmaj al - xxmaj khamayseh ) . xxmaj in his confession to the xxmaj public ( or xxmaj state ) xxmaj prosecutor , xxmaj mr xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher alleged that the applicant had provided prior encouragement for the attacks . xxmaj he was also said to have congratulated the group after the attacks . \n",
       "  13.mr xxmaj al xxmaj hamasher , along with several other defendants , had complained during the proceedings before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court that they had been tortured by the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj general xxmaj intelligence xxmaj directorate ( “ the xxup gid ” ) , which shares responsibility for maintaining internal security and monitoring security threats in xxmaj jordan with the xxmaj public xxmaj security xxmaj directorate and the military . xxmaj at the end of the period of interrogation during which they claimed to have been tortured , the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor took a statement from each defendant . \n",
       "  14.at the trial there was evidence from lawyers and medical examiners and relatives of the defendants that there were visible signs of torture on the defendants . xxmaj however , the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court concluded that the defendants could not prove torture . \n",
       "  15.there were a number of appeals to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and remittals back to the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , although , as the applicant had been convicted in absentia , no appeals were taken on his behalf . xxmaj in the course of those appeals , the convictions were upheld on the basis that the relevant statements had been made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the confessions in those statements thus constituted sufficient evidence for conviction if the court accepted them and if the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was satisfied with the confessions . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected the claim that the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor had to prove that the defendants had confessed to him of their own accord : the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor ’s obligation to prove that a confession was obtained willingly only arose where the confession had not been obtained by him . xxmaj the confessions in question were authentic and there was no evidence that they had been made under financial or moral coercion . \n",
       "  16.the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation then considered the impact of the allegations that the confessions to the xxmaj state xxmaj prosecutor had resulted from coercion of the defendants and their families while they were in xxup gid detention . xxmaj such conduct during an investigation was against xxmaj jordanian law and rendered the perpetrators liable to punishment . xxmaj however , even assuming that the defendants’ allegations were true , that would not nullify the confessions made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor unless it were proved that those confessions were the consequence of illegal coercion to force the defendants to confess to things which they had not done . xxmaj the defendants had not shown that was the case . \n",
       "  17.as a result of the applicant ’s conviction in this trial , the xxmaj jordanian authorities requested the applicant ’s extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in early 2000 , the request was withdrawn by xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  2.the millennium conspiracy trial \n",
       "  18.in the autumn of 2000 the applicant was again tried in absentia in xxmaj jordan , this time in a case known as the “ millennium conspiracy ” , which concerned a conspiracy to cause explosions at western and xxmaj israeli targets in xxmaj jordan to coincide with the millennium celebrations . xxmaj the conspiracy was uncovered before the attacks could be carried out . xxmaj the applicant was alleged to have provided money for a computer and encouragement through his writings , which had been found at the house of a co - defendant , mrabuhawsher . xxmaj the applicant maintains that the main evidence against him was the testimony of xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher . \n",
       "  19.most of the defendants were convicted on most charges ; some were fully or partly acquitted . xxmaj the applicant was convicted and sentenced to 15years’ imprisonment with hard labour . xxmaj other defendants , including abuhawsher , were sentenced to death . xxmaj on appeal certain of the defendants , including , it appears , xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , claimed to have been tortured during 50days of interrogation when they were denied access to lawyers . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected this ground of appeal , holding that the minutes of interrogation showed that each defendant had been told of his right to remain silent about the charges unless their lawyer was present . xxmaj the applicant also states that the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation found that the alleged ill - treatment in xxup gid custody was irrelevant because the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court did not rely on the defendants’ confessions to the xxup gid but their confessions to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher remains under sentence of death . \n",
       "  20.the findings of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj special xxmaj immigration xxmaj appeals xxmaj commission ( xxup siac ) in respect of the evidence presented at each trial are set out at paragraph 45 below . xxmaj the further evidence which has become available since xxup siac ’s findings , and which has been submitted to this xxmaj court , is summarised as paragraphs 94–105 below . \n",
       "  c.the agreement of a memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  21.in xxmaj october 2001 , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office advised the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government that xxmaj article 3 of the xxmaj convention precluded the deportation of terrorist suspects to xxmaj jordan . xxmaj in xxmaj march 2003 , after a xxmaj government review of the possibility of removing such barriers to removal , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office confirmed that its advice of xxmaj october 2001 remained extant but that it was considering whether key countries would be willing and able to provide the appropriate assurances to guarantee that potential deportees would be treated in a manner consistent with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ’s obligations . xxmaj in xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj foreign xxmaj secretary agreed that seeking specific and credible assurances from foreign governments , in the form of memoranda of understanding , might be a way of enabling deportation from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  22.in xxmaj november 2003 , the xxmaj british xxmaj embassy in xxmaj amman was instructed to raise the idea of a framework memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) with the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj in xxmaj february 2005 , after meetings between the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan , and between the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj foreign xxmaj minister , agreement was reached on the principle of an xxup mou . \n",
       "  23.further negotiations took place in xxmaj june 2005 and an xxup mou was signed on 10 xxmaj august 2005 . xxmaj that xxup mou set out a series of assurances of compliance with international human rights standards , which would be adhered to when someone was returned to one xxmaj state from the other ( see paragraph 76 below ) . xxmaj the same day , a side letter from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj charg d’affaires , xxmaj amman , to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior was signed , which recorded the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government ’s ability to give assurances in individual cases that the death penalty would not be imposed . xxmaj in respect of the applicant , further questions as to the conduct of any retrial he would face after deportation were also put to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and answered in xxmaj may 2006 by the xxmaj legal xxmaj adviser at the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of xxmaj foreign xxmaj affairs . \n",
       "  24.the xxup mou also made provision for any person returned under it to contact and have prompt and regular visits from a representative of an independent body nominated jointly by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordanian xxmaj governments . xxmaj on 24 xxmaj october 2005 , the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre for xxmaj human xxmaj rights xxmaj studies ( “ the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ” ) signed a monitoring agreement with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government . xxmaj on 13 xxmaj february 2006 , the terms of reference for the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre were agreed ( see paragraph 80 below ) . \n",
       "  d.the applicant ’s appeal against deportation \n",
       "  25.on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , that is , the day after the xxup mou was signed , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with the notice of intention to deport . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state certified that the decision to deport the applicant was taken in the interests of national security . xxmaj the applicant appealed to xxup siac against that decision arguing , inter alia , that it was incompatible with xxmaj articles 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj relying on his previous asylum claim , he argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the xxmaj jordanian authorities . xxmaj if returned , he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would thus face lengthy pre - trial detention ( in breach of xxmaj article 5 ) and , if convicted , would face a long term of imprisonment . xxmaj all these factors meant he was at real risk of torture , either pre - trial or after conviction , to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons . xxmaj he was also at risk of the death penalty or rendition to other countries , such as the xxmaj united xxmaj states of xxmaj america . xxmaj relying on xxmaj article 6 , he alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair : the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , a military court , lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture – either of him , his co - defendants or other prisoners – would be admitted against him . \n",
       "  1.proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  ( a)the conduct of proceedings before xxup siac and its national security findings \n",
       "  26.the applicant ’s appeal was dismissed by xxup siac on 26 xxmaj february 2007 . xxmaj the appeal had been heard by xxup siac in two parts : an “ open session ” , where the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case and evidence was presented in the presence of the applicant and his representatives , and a “ closed session ” where parts of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case which could not be disclosed for security reasons were presented ( see paragraph 69 below ) . xxup siac heard evidence in closed session relating to the process by which the xxup mou had been agreed , the extent to which it would mitigate the risk of torture and also evidence as to the national security threat the applicant was alleged to have posed to the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ( “ closed material ” ) . xxmaj in the closed sessions , the applicant and his representatives were excluded but his interests were represented by special advocates . xxup siac then delivered an “ open judgment ” , which is publicly available , and a “ closed judgment ” , which was given only to the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state and the special advocates . \n",
       "  27.in reaching its decision as to whether the applicant ’s deportation was necessary in the interests of national security , xxup siac considered the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case to be “ well proved ” since the applicant was regarded by many terrorists as a spiritual adviser whose views legitimised acts of violence . xxmaj however , xxup siac did not take into account either of the applicant ’s xxmaj jordanian convictions in absentia , which were originally advanced as part of the xxmaj government ’s case . xxmaj the reason for this was that the xxmaj government had adopted what was described as a “ pragmatic approach ” in withdrawing reliance upon any evidence which it was alleged might have been obtained by torture on the grounds that it would require an investigation as to whether it was obtained by torture . xxmaj this was done in accordance the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords’ ruling in xxup a. and others ( no . 2 ) to that effect ( see paragraphs 136 and 137 below ) . \n",
       "  xxup 28.siac then reviewed the evidence it had heard from various sources including a senior xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom diplomat , xxmaj mr xxmaj mark xxmaj oakden , who gave evidence on the negotiation of the xxup mou , the monitoring agreement with the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre and on the risk faced by the applicant in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj on behalf of the applicant , it heard evidence on the xxmaj jordanian regime from three academics . xxmaj it also received evidence from an xxmaj arabic speaking barrister , msrana xxmaj refahi , who had travelled to xxmaj jordan to conduct research on the previous two trials including interviews with the defendants and their lawyers . xxmaj additionally , it considered evidence of the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government ’s interest in the applicant and allegations that a xxmaj jordanian national had been the subject of extraordinary rendition from xxmaj jordan to the xxmaj united xxmaj states . \n",
       "  ( b)siac ’s findings on the xxup mou \n",
       "  xxup 29.siac found that this xxmaj court ’s judgments in xxmaj chahal v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , 15 xxmaj november 1996 , xxmaj reports of xxmaj judgments and xxmaj decisions xxup 1996v and xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov v. xxmaj turkey [ xxup gc ] , nos . 46827 / 99 and 46951 / 99 , xxup echr xxup 2005i , showed that reliance could lawfully be placed on assurances ; but the weight to be given depended on the circumstances of each case . xxmaj there was a difference between relying on an assurance which required a xxmaj state to act in a way which would not accord with its normal law and an assurance which required a xxmaj state to adhere to what its law required but which might not be fully or regularly observed in practice . xxmaj referring to a decision of the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture , xxmaj agiza v. xxmaj sweden ( see paragraph 147 below ) , where the xxmaj swedish authorities had expelled an xxmaj egyptian national after receiving assurances from xxmaj egypt , xxup siac continued : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the case of xxmaj agiza stands as a clear warning of the dangers of simple reliance on a form of words and diplomatic monitoring . xxmaj there were already warning signs which ought to have alerted the xxmaj swedish authorities to the risks , including the role they had permitted to a foreign intelligence organisation . xxmaj but we note what to us are the crucial differences : the strength , duration and depth of the bilateral relationship between the two countries by comparison with any that has been pointed to between xxmaj sweden and xxmaj egypt ; the way in which the negotiations over the xxup mou have proceeded and the diplomatic assessment of their significance ; the particular circumstances of [ the present applicant ] and xxmaj jordan ; the degree of risk at the various stages , in the absence of the xxup mou , particularly at the early stages of detention which is when the risk from torture by the xxup gid would normally be at its greatest and when the confirmed torture of xxmaj agiza in xxmaj egypt appears to have occurred ; and the speed with which the monitors would be seeking and we believe obtaining access to the xxmaj appellant in those early days . xxmaj the xxmaj swedes felt that to seek to see xxmaj agiza would betray a want of confidence in the xxmaj egyptians , whereas there is no such feeling in either the xxup uk , the [ xxmaj adaleh ] xxmaj centre or the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj quite the reverse applies . xxmaj one aspect of that case which also troubled the [ xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture ] was that xxmaj agiza had been removed without final judicial determination of his case . xxmaj that would not be the position here . ” \n",
       "  30.in the present case , the political situation in xxmaj jordan and the freedom , albeit limited , of non - governmental organisations , the press and xxmaj parliament to express concerns would reduce the risks the applicant faced . xxmaj in addition , the level of scrutiny xxmaj jordan had accepted under the xxup mou could not but show that it was willing to abide by its terms and spirit . xxmaj each country had a real interest in preventing breaches of the xxup mou : the diplomatic relationship between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan was friendly and long - standing and of real value to xxmaj jordan and it would have a real incentive to avoid being seen as having broken its word . xxmaj both countries had an interest in maintaining co - operation on counter - terrorism matters . xxmaj the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom had a very real concern that it should be able to remove foreign nationals without breaching their rights under xxmaj article 3 , so failure in such a highly publicised case would be a major setback for that process . xxmaj that concern would thus act as a further incentive to investigate any breaches of the xxup mou . xxmaj while the xxup mou did not specify what steps would be taken in such an investigation , xxup siac accepted evidence from the xxmaj mr xxmaj oakden that any failure of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to respond to diplomatic queries would lead to “ rapidly escalating diplomatic and xxmaj ministerial contacts and reactions ” . \n",
       "  xxup 31.siac accepted that there were some weaknesses in the xxup mou and monitoring provisions . xxmaj some protections , such as prompt access to a lawyer , recorded interviews , independent medical examinations and prohibition on undisclosed places of detention , were not explicitly present but , in reality , most of these aspects were covered . xxmaj there was no guarantee that access to the applicant , as required by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s terms of reference , would always be granted but any refusal would be brought to light quite quickly ; in the early period of detention , the xxmaj centre was expected to visit the applicant three times a week . xxup siac also expected the xxup gid and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to react swiftly to any approach by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom were a visit to be refused . xxmaj it was “ disturbing ” that the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj special xxmaj rapporteur on xxmaj torture had been refused access to a xxup gid facility in xxmaj june 2006 , despite a prior arrangement that he would be permitted free access . xxmaj however , on the evidence it had heard , xxup siac found that there was no real risk of ill - treatment of the applicant by the xxup gid . xxmaj there was a weakness in the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s “ relative inexperience and scale ” ; it would be undertaking a task which would be new to it ; and it did not have the expertise among its staff , as it had recognised . xxmaj it was a fairly new body with limited resources and staff , although this could be overcome and the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government would bear the cost . xxmaj it was the very fact of monitoring visits which was important and the absence of specialist expertise was not fatal to their value . \n",
       "  ( c)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 3 \n",
       "  32.the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government did not contest the general thrust of the available material in relation to xxmaj jordan ’s human rights record and , in xxup siac ’s view , details of human rights violations in xxmaj jordan remained relevant to the assessment of the risk faced by the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj government also took the position that it could not return the applicant to xxmaj jordan , in conformity with its international obligations , in the absence of the particular measures contained in the xxup mou . xxmaj nevertheless , xxup siac found it important to consider the risks faced by the applicant by reference to the likely sequence of events if he were to be returned . xxmaj it found that the xxup mou might not be necessary for each risk but rather reinforce the protection available . \n",
       "  xxup 33.siac accepted that , on return , the applicant would be taken into the custody of the xxup gid and retried on the two charges for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would be accompanied by a representative of the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre to his place of detention and be medically examined . xxup siac also accepted that the xxup gid would interrogate the applicant with a view to obtaining a confession for use at trial and for more general intelligence purposes , though xxup siac found it to be speculative that xxup gid would interrogate the applicant about other offences in order to bring further charges against him ; there was no evidence of any other charges outstanding . xxup siac also accepted that the xxmaj united xxmaj states would seek to question the applicant and that this would take place soon after his arrival in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj however , there was no real risk that xxmaj article 3 would be breached before the conclusion of the retrial . \n",
       "  34.there was a real risk of torture or ill - treatment of an “ ordinary xxmaj islamist extremist ” in xxup gid detention before charge since such ill - treatment was widespread and longstanding and there was a climate of impunity and evasion of international monitoring in the xxup gid . xxmaj however , the applicant would be protected by his high profile , by the xxup mou and the monitoring agreement , especially since the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would be “ keen to prove its mettle ” and would itself be subject to the vigilance of other nongovernmental organisations . xxmaj this would also prevent any real risk of the use by the xxup gid of tactics such as last - minute refusals of access , claims that the applicant did not wish to see the monitors or moving him elsewhere without notification . xxmaj access by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would also prevent the applicant ’s incommunicado detention . \n",
       "  35.the xxup mou would also counteract the climate of impunity prevailing in the xxup gid and toleration of torture by its senior members . xxmaj the xxup mou and the monitoring arrangements were supported at the highest levels in xxmaj jordan – the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan ’s political power and prestige were behind the xxup mou – so it was reasonable to assume that instructions on how to treat the applicant had been given to the xxup gid and it would be aware that any breaches would not go unpunished . xxmaj moreover , senior members of the xxup gid had participated in the xxup mou negotiations and therefore would know the consequences of any failure to comply . xxmaj even if abuses were normally the work of rogue officers , the specific and unusual position of the applicant and the effect of the xxup mou would lead to senior officers preventing ill - treatment in his case , even if they did so only out of self - interest . \n",
       "  36.questioning by the xxmaj united xxmaj states was not forbidden by the xxup mou and , to xxup siac , it was probable that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj central xxmaj intelligence xxmaj agency would be allowed to question the applicant directly with the xxup gid present . xxmaj however , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would have made clear to the xxmaj united xxmaj states its interests in ensuring that the xxup mou was not breached . xxmaj the xxmaj jordanian authorities and xxmaj united xxmaj states would be careful to ensure that the xxmaj united xxmaj states did not “ overstep the mark ” . xxmaj assuming that the applicant remained in xxup gid custody and was not surrendered to the xxmaj united xxmaj states , there would be no real risk of ill - treatment at the pre - trial stage . xxmaj it was also highly unlikely that the applicant would be placed in any secret xxup gid or xxup cia detention facility in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  37.the same factors applied to any questioning which might take place soon after the conviction or acquittal of the applicant . xxmaj the xxup mou would continue to apply and it would be in the interests of both the xxmaj jordanians and the xxmaj americans to conduct any interrogation at the earliest opportunity rather than wait until after trial . xxmaj the applicant ’s high profile was also found to be “ unlikely to diminish much for some years ” . \n",
       "  38.there was little likelihood of the xxmaj jordanian authorities bringing any subsequent charges which carried the death penalty or seeking the death penalty in respect of the charges for which the applicant was to be retried . xxmaj instead , if he were convicted , the applicant would face a lengthy period of imprisonment . xxmaj there was a real risk of a life sentence in respect of the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge conspiracy , although there was a greater prospect that it would be considerably less because of the way in which sentences on the other defendants appeared to have been reduced on appeal , to 4 or 5 years . xxmaj there was no real risk of a life sentence in the millennium conspiracy retrial . xxmaj there was no rule that would prevent a higher sentence being imposed than the 15 year sentence that had been imposed in absentia . xxmaj however , the clear practice was against imposing higher sentences in retrials following initial convictions in absentia and there was no reason why a more unfavourable view would be taken of the applicant when he was present than when he was absent . xxmaj the applicant would serve any sentence in an ordinary prison and not a xxup gid detention facility ; the sentence of hard labour did not connote any additional punishment . xxmaj general conditions would not breach xxmaj article 3 and , although beatings sometimes occurred , there was no evidence that the applicant would be targeted as a political xxmaj islamist prisoner . xxmaj his status would again act to protect him . \n",
       "  39.in respect of rendition , there were “ powerful incentives ” for the xxmaj jordanian and xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj governments not to allow this to happen , not least the real domestic political difficulties this would create for the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and the unwillingness of the xxmaj united xxmaj states to destabilise the xxmaj jordanian regime . xxmaj any instances of alleged rendition from xxmaj jordan had involved people of other nationalities or , in one case , of a dual xxup us / xxmaj jordanian national . xxmaj it was also very unlikely that the applicant would be removed to a secret xxup cia facility in xxmaj jordan since this would require the connivance of the xxmaj jordanian authorities contrary to the xxup mou . xxmaj it was also unlikely that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government would seek the extradition of the applicant from xxmaj jordan when it had not sought his extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and there would be political difficulties for xxmaj jordan to accede to such a request . \n",
       "  ( d)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 5 \n",
       "  40.in relation to the applicant ’s detention following his removal to xxmaj jordan , xxup siac found that the time limits for notifying the legal authorities of an arrest ( 48 hours ) and for bringing formal charges ( 15 days ) were regularly and lawfully extended by the courts at the request of the prosecutor , in stages of up to 15 days to a maximum of 50 days . xxmaj it would therefore be compatible with xxmaj jordanian law for the applicant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a court before being charged . xxmaj such extensions were approved by a judicial authority , although not necessarily in the physical presence of the suspect . \n",
       "  xxup 41.siac noted that the xxup mou did not explicitly require that there be no extensions of time beyond the initial 15 day detention but required that a returned person be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorised by law to determine the lawfulness of his detention . xxmaj though “ promptly ” was not defined in the xxup mou , xxup siac found that this part of the xxup mou would be carried out , particularly since this was one of the earliest points at which the xxup mou would be engaged , and that the applicant ’s first appearance before a judicial authority would be within 48 hours . xxmaj it would not breach the xxup mou if the applicant were to be detained for a maximum of 50 days , by means of judicially approved 15 day extensions , or if he were absent when those later decisions were taken . xxmaj however , in reality the total period of 50 days was unlikely to be sought , even without the xxup mou , because the applicant faced a retrial and the case dossiers had already been through the trial and appeal process a number of times . \n",
       "  ( e)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 6 \n",
       "  42.it was common ground before xxup siac that the applicant ’s previous convictions would be set aside and he would face retrial before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court on the same charges . \n",
       "  43.in addition to his two challenges to the retrial process ( the impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the use of evidence obtained by torture ) the applicant also argued that he would be questioned in detention without the presence of a lawyer by the xxup gid , xxmaj united xxmaj states officials or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the latter had the power under xxmaj article 64(3 ) of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj criminal xxmaj trial xxmaj procedures xxmaj code to conduct an investigation in the absence of a lawyer “ whenever he [ deemed ] it necessary in order to reveal the truth ” . xxmaj this decision was not subject to review , though xxup siac also noted that a confession before the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was not admissible unless the individual had been warned that he need not answer questions without his lawyer present . xxup siac thought it unlikely that the applicant would have a lawyer present during questioning by the xxup gid or xxmaj united xxmaj states officials but very likely he would have access to a lawyer for any appearance before a judge or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj in terms of pre - trial preparation by the defence , the period and facilities available would be less extensive than in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom but nonetheless better than would normally be the case in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  44.with regard to the lack of independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , xxup siac found that the court would consist of three judges , at least two of whom would be legally qualified military officers with no security of tenure . xxmaj the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor would also be a military officer . xxmaj appeal would lie to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , a civilian court , though that court could not hear argument on any unfairness of the trial arising from the military composition of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . \n",
       "  45.as to the potential use of evidence obtained by torture in the applicant ’s retrial , xxup siac found as follows : \n",
       "  “ 418.the xxmaj jordanian legal system , by its terms , does not therefore permit the use of involuntary confession or incriminatory statements . xxmaj there is a judicial examination of allegations of that nature before the evidence is admitted . xxmaj those allegations can themselves be tested by evidence . xxmaj how far those allegations can be practicably tested is affected by certain features of the system . xxmaj the burden of proof for excluding confessions made to the xxmaj prosecutor lies on the defendant . xxmaj there is obvious difficulty in proving prior acts or threats by the xxup gid in the absence of systems for recording questioning , for ensuring the presence of lawyers during questioning , and independent prompt medical examinations . xxmaj there is likely to be considerable reluctance on the part of the xxmaj court to accept that confessions to the xxmaj prosecutor , a common source of evidence , are tainted by ill - treatment . xxmaj the xxmaj court or xxmaj prosecutor does not appear prepared to compel the appearance of xxup gid officials to testify about these allegations . xxmaj there may be a sense that these allegations are made routinely , as a matter of defence strategy . \n",
       "  419.there may well be a greater willingness to test the nature of confessions made only in the course of xxup gid questioning . xxmaj there is some evidence that at least at xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation level , confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture have been excluded , ( though it is not clear whether those were made to the xxup gid or to the xxmaj prosecutor ) . \n",
       "  420.however , the general background evidence and that specific to the two trials in question shows that there is at least a very real risk that the incriminating statements against the [ applicant ] were obtained as a result of treatment by the xxup gid which breached xxmaj article 3 xxup echr ; it may or may not have amounted to torture . xxmaj it is very improbable that those statements would be excluded on the retrial , because the ssct is unlikely to be persuaded that they were so obtained , particularly having already rejected that assertion at the first trials , although the makers could give evidence that they were so obtained and were in fact untrue . ” \n",
       "  xxmaj there was , therefore , a high probability that the past statements made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor which incriminated the applicant would be admitted . xxup siac further found that those statements would be of considerable , perhaps decisive , importance against him . xxmaj on this aspect of the retrial , xxup siac held : \n",
       "  “ 439.to us , the question comes back to whether or not it is unfair for the burden of proof in xxmaj jordan to lie where it does on this issue ; we do not think that to be unfair in itself . xxmaj however , this burden of proof appears to be unaccompanied by some of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment or means of assisting its proof eg video or other recording of questioning by the xxup gid , limited periods of detention for questioning , invariable presence of lawyers , routine medical examination , assistance from the xxmaj court in calling relevant officials or doctors . xxmaj the decisions are also made by a court which lacks independence and does not appear to examine closely or vigorously allegations of this nature . xxmaj it is taking these points in combination which leads us to conclude that the trial would be likely to be unfair within xxmaj article 6 because of the way the allegations about involuntary statements would be considered . ” \n",
       "  xxup 46.siac concluded that , despite its findings in respect of the independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 , there would be no flagrant denial of justice under xxmaj article 6 of the xxmaj convention if the applicant were retried in xxmaj jordan . xxup siac stated that the retrial would take place “ within a legally constructed framework covering the court system , the procedural rules and the offences ” , the applicant would be present and it would be in public . xxmaj the dossier from the original trial would be before the retrial court but the applicant could effectively challenge its contents . xxmaj the execution of xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine and the difficulty faced by other witnesses , notably xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , would not make the retrial unfair . xxup siac concluded : \n",
       "  “ 446.we accept the lack of institutional independence in the ssct . xxmaj the lack of independence for ssct xxmaj judges is in the structure and system . xxmaj there is no evidence as to why particular judges might be chosen for particular cases , or that they are ‘ leaned on’ . xxmaj but the ssct is not a mere tool of the executive : there is sound evidence that it appraises the evidence and tests it against the law , and acquits a number of defendants . xxmaj it has reduced sentences over time . \n",
       "  447.its judges have legal training and are career military lawyers . xxmaj there is a very limited basis beyond that for saying that they would be partial , and that has not been the gravamen of the complaint . xxmaj their background may well make them sceptical about allegations of abuse by the xxup gid affecting statements made to the xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj they may instinctively share the view that allegations of ill - treatment are a routine part of a defence case to excuse the incrimination of others . xxmaj the legal framework is poorly geared to detecting and acting upon allegations of abuse . xxmaj the way in which it approaches the admission of evidence , on the material we have , shows no careful scrutiny of potentially tainted evidence . xxmaj there would be considerable publicity given to the retrial and public trials can encourage greater care and impartiality in the examination of the evidence . xxmaj this would not be a mere show trial , nor were the first trials ; nor would the result be a foregone conclusion , regardless of the evidence . \n",
       "  448.reasons are given for the decisions , and an appeal to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation is available . xxmaj the fact that such an appeal can not cure the want of structural independence in the ssct is not a reason for discounting its existence in the overall assessment of whether there would be a complete denial of xxmaj article 6 rights . xxmaj this xxmaj court is a civilian court and the evidence of undue executive influence through appointment or removal is quite sparse . xxmaj there is no evidence again as to how its panels are chosen , nor that they are “ leaned on ” by the executive . xxmaj it plainly operates as a corrective to the rulings of the ssct on law and procedure , and is of some relevance to factual matters , even though it does not hear the evidence all over again or have a full factual jurisdiction except on xxmaj prosecutors’ appeals . xxmaj the probable sentences are not wholly disproportionate to the offences . \n",
       "  449.we have discussed at length the approach of the ssct to the admission of statements to a prosecutor allegedly given as a result of prior ill - treatment . xxmaj although we take the view that a contribution of factors would probably make the retrial unfair in that respect , they do not constitute a complete denial of a fair trial . xxmaj the existence of a legal prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence can not be ignored , nor the fact that the ssct would hear evidence relating to the allegations . xxmaj the role of the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation in reviewing and at times overturning the conclusions of the ssct on this issue is material . xxmaj the want of evidential or procedural safeguards to balance the burden of proof , and the probable cast of mind towards statements made to a prosecutor / judge in a civil law system , all within a security court dominated by military lawyers , does not suffice for a complete denial of justice . \n",
       "  450.there is a danger , given the inevitable focus on what is said to be potentially unfair about the retrial , in focussing exclusively on deficiencies when deciding whether there would be a total denial of the right to a fair trial , rather than looking at the picture of the trial as a whole . xxmaj that is what has to be done however and it is that picture as a whole which has led us to our conclusion on this issue . \n",
       "  451.the various factors which would be likely to cause the retrial to breach xxmaj article 6 are to a considerable degree interlinked . xxmaj taking them in the round does not persuade us that there is a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial . ” \n",
       "  47.finally , while there was the real prospect of a long term of imprisonment , this did not alter xxup siac ’s conclusion that the overall nature of the retrial would not be a total denial of the applicant ’s rights . \n",
       "  2.proceedings before the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal \n",
       "  48.the applicant appealed to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , which gave judgment on 9 xxmaj april 2008 , unanimously allowing the appeal in respect of xxmaj article 6 and the risk of the use of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 and dismissing it on all other grounds ( [ 2008 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 290 ) . \n",
       "  49.for the applicant ’s complaints under xxmaj article 3 as to the use of closed evidence by xxup siac and the reliance on the assurances in the xxup mou , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal considered it was bound by its previous ruling on these questions in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb ( xxmaj algeria ) , u ( xxmaj algeria ) v. the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department [ 2007 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 808 , which had found that : ( i ) xxup siac could consider closed evidence on safety on return ; and ( ii ) the relevance of assurances to safety on return was a matter of fact not law and thus it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on that ground . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also rejected the applicant ’s appeals based on xxmaj article 5 , finding that xxup siac was entitled to find as it did . \n",
       "  50.for xxmaj article 6 , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal rejected the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk of a “ flagrant denial of justice ” in his retrial in xxmaj jordan by reason of a lack of independence and or impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court : xxup siac had been entitled to find as it did on this point and this conclusion was not altered by the later decision of this xxmaj court in almoayad v. xxmaj germany ( dec . ) , no . 35865 / 03 , 20 xxmaj february 2007 . \n",
       "  51.however , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal accepted the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk that he would suffer a “ flagrant denial of justice ” by reason of the risk that statements obtained through treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 would be admitted as evidence against him in his retrial . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed : \n",
       "  “ xxup 45.siac understated or misunderstood the fundamental nature in xxmaj convention law of the prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by torture . xxmaj counsel for the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state said that it was no part of his submission to say that if it is clear that a trial will take place on the basis of evidence obtained under torture , whether of the individual themselves , or third parties , that that would not involve flagrant denial of justice . xxmaj accordingly , once xxup siac had found as a fact that there was a high probability that evidence that may very well have been obtained by torture ( xxup siac , 436 ) ; or in respect of which there was a very real risk that it had been obtained by torture or other conduct breaching article 3 ( xxup siac , 437 ) ; would be admitted at the trial of mrothman ; then xxup siac had to be satisfied that such evidence would be excluded or not acted on . xxmaj the grounds relied on by xxup siac for not finding a threatened breach of article 6 in that respect were insufficient . \n",
       "  46.we emphasise that that is not or not primarily a criticism of xxup siac ’s reasoning in terms of rationality , though we do consider additionally that xxup siac ’s conclusions did not follow rationally from its findings of fact . xxmaj rather , our principal finding is that xxup siac erred by applying an insufficiently demanding test to determine the issue of whether article 6 rights would be breached . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  48.the use of evidence obtained by torture is prohibited in xxmaj convention law not just because that will make the trial unfair , but also and more particularly because of the connexion of the issue with article 3 , a fundamental , unconditional and non - derogable prohibition that stands at the centre of the xxmaj convention protections . xxmaj as the ecthr put it in 105 of its judgment in xxmaj jalloh v xxmaj germany 44 xxup ehrr 32 : \n",
       "  ‘ incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture - should never be relied on as proof of the victim ’s guilt , irrespective of its probative value . xxmaj any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of xxmaj art.3 of the xxmaj convention sought to proscribe or , as it was so well put in the xxup us xxmaj supreme xxmaj court ’s judgment in the xxmaj rochin case 342 xxup us 165 , “ to afford brutality the cloak of law”.’ \n",
       "  xxmaj that view , that the use of evidence obtained by torture or ill - treatment is prohibited not just , or indeed primarily , because of its likely unreliability , but rather because the state must stand firm against the conduct that has produced the evidence , is universally recognised both within and outside xxmaj convention law . \n",
       "  xxmaj what is , with respect , a particularly strong statement to that effect , citing a multitude of equally strongly worded authorities , is to be found in 17 of the speech of xxmaj lord xxmaj bingham in a v xxmaj home xxmaj secretary ( xxmaj no2 ) [ 2006 ] 2 xxup ac 221 . \n",
       "  xxup 49.siac was wrong not to recognise this crucial difference between breaches of article 6 based on this ground and breaches of article 6 based simply on defects in the trial process or in the composition of the court . xxmaj rather , in its conclusions in 442452 of its determination ... it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the independence of the court : see in particular xxup siac at 449 - 450 . xxmaj that caused it not to recognise the high degree of assurance that is required in relation to proceedings in a foreign state before a person may lawfully be deported to face a trial that may involve evidence obtained by torture . ” \n",
       "  52.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal noted that xxup siac had reached its conclusion that there would not be a complete denial of justice in relation to the use of evidence obtained by torture by relying on the process , admittedly not wholly satisfactory , before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation . xxmaj for the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal that conclusion sat very ill with xxup siac ’s own findings about the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court process , in particular xxup siac ’s own concern as to the difficulties in proving that evidence had been obtained by torture . xxmaj in the opinion of the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , xxup siac ’s concern was “ amply justified by the litany of lack of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment ” in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj it also criticised xxup siac ’s “ disturbing failure ” to give proper weight to the findings as to the defects in the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj it was not open to xxup siac to conclude on that evidence that the risk of the total denial of justice that is represented by the use of evidence obtained by torture had been adequately excluded . xxup siac could not have so concluded if it had properly understood the status in xxmaj convention law of this aspect of article 6 . ” \n",
       "  3.proceedings before the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords \n",
       "  53.the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state appealed to the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords in relation to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal ’s conclusion on xxmaj article 6 . xxmaj the applicant cross - appealed in relation to his other xxmaj convention complaints . xxmaj the appeal was heard with the appeals of two of the appellants in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb and u ( see paragraph 48 above ) . xxmaj in the conjoined appeals the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords was therefore able to consider the use of closed material before xxup siac , the reliance on the assurances contained in the xxup mou and the applicant ’s xxmaj articles5 and 6 complaints . xxmaj the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords gave judgment on 18february 2009 unanimously allowing the xxmaj government ’s appeal and dismissing the applicant ’s cross - appeal ( [ 2009 ] xxup ukhl 10 ) . \n",
       "  ( a)article 3 : the “ closed ” proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  54.lord xxmaj phillips held that xxup siac was lawfully entitled to consider closed material in evaluating safety on return and there were cogent considerations of policy for doing so . a distinction had to be drawn between closed material on safety on return and the use of closed material in other proceedings , for example to establish the national security threat posed by an individual . xxmaj for the former , the individual would normally be aware of the nature of any risk on return and , in any event , it was for the individual himself , and not the xxmaj state , to make out his case on whether he would be at risk on return . xxmaj it was not likely to be critically important for a special advocate to be able to obtain input from the person to be deported in relation to closed evidence . xxmaj as regards the impracticality of obtaining an appropriate expert witness with security clearance to see the material , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips did not regard the problem as unfair . xxup siac ’s rules of procedure enabled the special advocate to ask xxup siac to call for more evidence and xxup siac , as an expert tribunal , could be relied upon “ to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate ’s submission ” . xxmaj in respect of the assurances , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips endorsed the view that the assurances contained in the xxup mou had to be disclosed but details of the negotiations leading to the xxup mou could be closed material . \n",
       "  55.lord xxmaj hoffmann rejected the applicant ’s argument on the more fundamental basis that he viewed this xxmaj court ’s case - law as making it clear that the determination whether a deportation order might infringe xxmaj article 3 did not require “ the full judicial panoply of article 6 or even 5(4 ) ” . xxmaj citing xxmaj chahal , cited above , he emphasised that all that was required was “ independent scrutiny of the claim ” , which had occurred in the applicant ’s case . \n",
       "  56.lord xxmaj hope agreed , albeit accepting that this xxmaj court had not yet had the opportunity to analyse whether the xxup siac system met the requirements of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj in his view , it did so . xxmaj lord xxmaj brown also agreed , emphasising that with regard to safety on return , no case was being made against the applicant ; rather it was he who was making a case against the returning xxmaj state . \n",
       "  ( b)article 3 : assurances and the xxup mou \n",
       "  57.lord xxmaj phillips ( with whom the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords agreed ) construed the this xxmaj court ’s case - law from xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , onwards as treating assurances “ as part of the matrix that had to be considered ” when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would face treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj he referred to the “ abundance ” of international law material , which supported the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by xxmaj state agents was endemic . xxmaj however , for xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips this came “ close to a ‘ xxmaj catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you can not rely on them ” . xxmaj in rejecting that proposition , he held that the only basis to interfere with the view of xxup siac was if its conclusions that the assurances could be relied upon were irrational and xxup siac ’s conclusions in the present case were not . \n",
       "  ( c)article 5 \n",
       "  58.the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords unanimously refused to interfere with the finding of fact by xxup siac that the applicant ’s exposure under xxmaj jordanian law to 50 days’ detention without access to a court or a lawyer , would not arise . xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found that , even if it would arise , 50 days’ detention would not constitute a flagrant breach of xxmaj article 5 . a flagrant breach was a breach whose consequences were so severe that they overrode the right of a xxmaj state to expel an alien from its territory . xxmaj that might be satisfied by arbitrary detention which lasted many years but not 50 days’ detention . \n",
       "  ( d)article 6 \n",
       "  59.on xxmaj article 6 , taking the test to be whether there would be a “ complete denial or nullification ” of the right to a fair trial , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips observed : \n",

       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he xxmaj strasbourg jurisprudence , tentative though it is , has led me to these conclusions . xxmaj before the deportation of an alien will be capable of violating article 6 there must be substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk ( i ) that there will be a fundamental breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 and ( ii ) that this failure will lead to a miscarriage of justice that itself constitutes a flagrant violation of the victim ’s fundamental rights . ” \n",

       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he prohibition on receiving evidence obtained by torture is not primarily because such evidence is unreliable or because the reception of the evidence will make the trial unfair . xxmaj rather it is because ‘ the state must stand firm against the conduct that produced the evidence’ . xxmaj that principle applies to the state in which an attempt is made to adduce such evidence . xxmaj it does not require this state , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , to retain in this country to the detriment of national security a terrorist suspect unless it has a high degree of assurance that evidence obtained by torture will not be adduced against him in xxmaj jordan ... xxmaj the issue before xxup siac was whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that if xxmaj mr xxmaj othman were deported to xxmaj jordan the criminal trial that he would there face would have defects of such significance as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of his trial or , as xxup siac put it , to amount to a total denial of the right to a fair trial . xxup siac concluded that the deficiencies that xxup siac had identified did not meet that exacting test . i do not find that in reaching this conclusion xxup siac erred in law . ” \n",
       "  63.lord xxmaj hoffmann found that there was no xxmaj convention authority for the rule that , in the context of the application of xxmaj article 6 to a removal case , the risk of the use of evidence obtained by torture necessarily amounted to a flagrant denial of justice . \n",
       "  64.lord xxmaj hope agreed . xxmaj he accepted that this xxmaj court had adopted an “ uncompromising approach ” to the use at trial of evidence obtained by torture but the evidence before xxup siac did not come up to that standard . xxmaj there were allegations but no proof . xxmaj the assertion that there was a real risk that the evidence was obtained by torture was not enough to prohibit removal . xxmaj he recalled xxup siac ’s findings that the retrial would probably not comply with xxmaj article 6 if xxmaj jordan were a party to the xxmaj convention but would take place within a legally constructed framework . xxmaj there was sound evidence that the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , which was not a mere tool of the executive , appraised the evidence and tested it against the law . xxup siac had therefore been entitled to find as it did on the evidence . \n",

       "  \" a landlord 's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances , his living conditions and / or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future . \n",

       "  xxmaj it should be noted that xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need . xxmaj the plaintiffs ' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought , since they even have a bedroom for their son . \n",
       "  xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving , as the onus was on them to do , that the relations between themselves and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents were permanently strained and conflictual . xxmaj what is certain , however , is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son 's illness and their living conditions in that house . \n",
       "  xxmaj it might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with xxunk xxmaj barreto 's parents , ' who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' - that in view of the xxunk ' xxmaj when a man marries he needs a house ' , cited by xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto in his first application , the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there . \n",

       "  xxmaj since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation , the fact that they live with xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , albeit by their favour , is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by xxmaj article 1096 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ... xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house . \n",

       "  22.according to a decision by the same prosecutor ’s office dated 20september 1995 , issued in case no . 97 / p / 1990 , the subject - matter of the investigation was specified as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj with regard to the aims of case no . 97 / p / 1990 , it is also necessary to specify the timeframe to be taken into account . xxmaj thus , it should be emphasised that the investigations focused on acts committed during the period which elapsed between the dispersion of the demonstration on xxmaj palace xxmaj square ordered by xxup n. xxmaj ceauşescu on 21december 1989 and the dictator ’s flight during the day of 22december 1989 . ” \n",

       "  25.the above - cited decision did not contain an exhaustive list of victims , the number of which it described as “ 130 dead and injured ” ; on the basis of other indications in the same decision , 49 persons were apparently killed and 89 injured by gunshots , including men , women and children – unarmed civilians , of whom only 42 were listed by name . \n",
       "  26.according to the above decision , the events were as follows : following the demonstrations against the authorities , which had begun in xxmaj timişoara , on 17december1989 the then xxmaj minster of xxmaj defence had issued an order to combat the demonstrators ( xxunk de xxunk ) . xxmaj the decision of 20september1995 stated that the above order had been worded as follows : “ xxmaj the armed forces must follow the warning procedure [ using the words ] stop , stop , or i will fire ; in the event of failure to comply with the warning , shots should be fired in the air then , if the warning is still ignored , shots should be fired towards the feet ” . xxmaj the decision of 20september1995 did not specify in what situations an armed intervention was required . \n",
       "  27.the decision further indicated that it had been impossible to establish the exact order of events , given the scale of the confrontation “ between , on the one hand , thousands or tens of thousands of demonstrators and , on the other , hundreds or thousands of servicemen from the security forces ” . xxmaj furthermore , the prosecutor ’s office pointed out that “ after the fall of the totalitarian regime , the xxmaj state institutions suffered from real paralysis , and [ were ] in a general situation of chaos and confusion ” , so that no on - site investigations were conducted , no samples were taken , ballistics reports commissioned or even autopsies conducted on the victims’ corpses . xxmaj equally , it was noted that “ certain institutions , the staff of which had been involved in dispersing the demonstrations , had failed to cooperate or had not given effective assistance in establishing the facts ” . \n",
       "  28.in addition , although 235 persons , some of had sustained gunshot wounds , had been detained and subjected to ill - treatment at the xxmaj bucharest xxmaj police xxmaj department ( xxmaj xxunk capitalei ) , the xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior had refused to identify the hierarchical superiors of the police officers who had committed those offences . \n",
       "  29.the decision of 20 xxmaj september 1995 also mentioned that no serviceman or xxmaj state agent had been a victim of violence on that occasion , so that the opening of fire against the unarmed civilian demonstrators had been unlawful . \n",

       "  xxmaj in addition , the prosecuting authorities noted that , in spite of the evidence submitted to the investigation file , the decision of 20 xxmaj september 1995 had not examined the liability of the head of the xxmaj patriotic xxmaj guards , xxmaj colonel xxup p.c. , nor that of the servicemen who had played a role in organising the procedure for executing the orders issued by the xxmaj head of xxmaj state or his xxmaj ministers . \n",
       "  xxmaj the prosecuting authorities noted that evidence had not been taken from certain injured parties during the investigation ; that servicemen belonging to those regiments which had been deployed to quell the demonstrators had not been questioned ; that the registers kept by the military units involved in the repression had not been requested and thus not checked ; and that the investigation had not considered the possible involvement of other public institutions , such as , for example , the use of vehicles belonging to the xxmaj post xxmaj office for transporting prisoners . \n",
       "  33.by a decision of the same day , namely 7 xxmaj december 2004 , the military prosecutor ’s office ordered the indictment of 102 persons , essentially officers , including high - ranking officers , from the xxmaj army , police and xxmaj securitate forces , for murder ( xxmaj articles 174 - 176 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , genocide ( xxmaj article357 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , inhuman treatment ( xxmaj article 358 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , attempts to commit those acts , complicity and instigation in the commission of the above acts and participation lato sensu ( participaţie improprie ) in them , acts committed “ during the period from 21to 30 xxmaj december 1989 ” . xxmaj sixteen civilians , including a former xxmaj president of xxmaj romania and a former xxmaj head of the xxmaj romanian xxmaj intelligence xxmaj service , were also charged . \n",

       "  xxmaj the above - cited letter mentioned another reason for the delay , namely decision no . 610 / 2007 of the xxmaj constitutional xxmaj court of 16 xxmaj july 2007 , which withdrew jurisdiction to conduct investigations in case no.97 / p / 1990 from the military prosecuting authorities at the xxmaj high xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and xxmaj justice and transferred it to the civil prosecutors , that is , to the prosecutor ’s office at the xxmaj high xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and xxmaj justice . xxmaj in the opinion of the head of the military prosecutor ’s office , as stated in the above - cited letter of 5june 2008 , the transfer of the case was sufficient to entail new delays in the proceedings , given the significant volume of the case file , the complexity of the case and the time that had elapsed since the events under investigation . \n",
       "  39.according to data submitted by the xxmaj government , following resumption of the investigation , evidence was taken from 2,800 witnesses and 320 injured parties in 2007 , while only 72 witnesses and 38 injured parties had been questioned in 2005 . xxmaj evidence was taken from xxunk and 210 injured parties in 2008 . 443 photographic xxunk and plates were examined in 2006 ; 175 were examined in 2007 . \n",

       "  xxup 44.a report drawn up on 3 xxmaj january 1990 following an external forensic examination , without an autopsy , at the xxmaj braşov forensic medical laboratory indicated that death had resulted from an injury inflicted by a firearm , which had caused an external haemorrhage . xxmaj according to a statement of 27november2008 by officer xxup c. , a medical doctor at the xxmaj braşov military hospital at the material time , he had received an order not to conduct autopsies on corpses . \n",
       "  45.on 26 xxmaj february 1990 the same doctor xxup c. from the military hospital submitted a “ report ” to the head of the xxmaj braşov county police , following a request from xxunk ] . xxmaj in this report , he stated that “ xxunk , between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. , the body of xxmaj vlase xxmaj nicolae , aged 19 years , from xxmaj braşov , killed in the xxmaj revolution , in the area of the county council building , was brought in ” and that “ on xxunk , he was transported to the morgue for a post - mortem examination ” . \n",

       "  xxunk , in the years 1991 - 2008 , the applicants submitted numerous pleadings to the prosecuting authorities at the xxmaj supreme xxmaj court of xxmaj justice and to the xxmaj minister of xxmaj justice and the xxmaj president of the xxmaj republic . xxmaj they asked that those who had tortured and killed their son be identified and held liable . xxmaj in 1999 they received , for the first time , information about the investigation . xxmaj according the third applicant ( xxmaj mrs xxmaj vlase ) , prior to that date the four prosecutors responsible for the investigation had merely recommended to her verbally that she be hospitalised for care and criticised her for failing to keep her son at home , and thus avoid him being killed . \n",

       "  xxmaj the decision indicated that it had not been possible to establish the exact location in the city centre where each of those persons had fallen , since the corpses had been removed before the gunfire had ended , in each case during the night , and they had been identified at a subsequent stage in the military hospital morgue , the county hospital or the forensic medical laboratory to which they had been taken . \n",
       "  xxmaj having noted that several hundred armed servicemen had intervened in order to protect the city ’s most important institutions from an imminent attack , but without identifying those buildings , the military prosecuting authorities stated that “ the gunfire had been started in error , without an order to that effect , in the specific conditions of the moment , namely stress , fear of alleged terrorists and fatigue on the part of the military officers ” . xxmaj the civilians found themselves caught in the crossfire between servicemen occupying opposing positions . xxmaj the large number of victims on the night of 22 to 23december1989 in xxmaj braşov city centre was also explained by the fact that the servicemen from the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj national xxmaj defence had used more than 270,000 cartridges , the xxmaj securitate militia had used xxunk and the xxmaj patriotic guards and those civilians who had obtained rifles had used xxunk . xxmaj machine guns had also been used and more than a hundred grenades had been thrown . \n",
       "  xxmaj the military prosecuting authorities considered that the lack of judgment shown by the commanders of the xxmaj braşov garrison in failing to take account of the state of mind of the military personnel placed under their command , their tiredness and the stress they were under , could not engage their criminal liability . xxmaj in their defence , the military prosecuting authorities noted the military officers’ lack of experience in urban combat and noted that they had not taken measures prior to the opening of fire in order to establish means of communication between the units deployed in the area . \n",
       "  49.the relevant parts of the decision read as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj when the gunfire began in the city centre , several hundred persons were present , including women and young people , who were responding to an appeal on the national television channel inviting them to take to the streets because the revolution was in danger . \n",

       "  xxmaj in those circumstances , dozens of people , including servicemen , were hit by bullets in the first minutes after the gunfire began . \n",
       "  xxmaj all of the servicemen who were in xxmaj braşov city centre that night , the vast majority of whom gave evidence , stated that they were tired , as the majority had been posted there since the previous night , namely 21 to 22 xxmaj december 1989 , that they were all afraid , because they had learned what was happening in xxmaj bucharest and that , on their own initiative , they had loaded their weapons , since they were expecting to be attacked from one moment to the next . \n",
       "  xxmaj in those circumstances , it had been sufficient that civilian xxup i.e. fire the first shots in the direction of persons whom he considered suspect for all of the servicemen in the city centre to open fire in turn , without prior orders from their commanders ... \n",
       "  xxmaj all of the armed individuals – both servicemen and civilians – who used their weapons in the city centre during the night of 22 to 23 xxmaj december 1989 were acting in good faith and were attached to the revolution , and were convinced that they were acting to protect it . xxmaj they used their weapons on account of the prevailing confusion and the considerable fear and suspicion which had taken hold of everyone who was in the streets . ” \n",

       "  52.by a decision of 30 xxmaj august 1999 , the military prosecuting authorities set aside the decision of 28 xxmaj december 1994 to discontinue proceedings , on the ground that the investigation had been incomplete and “ that there was no evidence to justify exonerating from criminal liability the persons who had been under an obligation to direct and coordinate the servicemen ’s actions ... in such a way as to maintain control of the situation and avoid loss of life or injuries to innocent persons ” . xxmaj in the same decision , the military prosecuting authorities noted that the circumstances in which xxup xxunk - type ” rifles had been distributed to civilians who had not been trained in their use had not been elucidated . xxmaj in addition , the persons directly responsible for the death of 39 persons and the injuries caused to xxunk servicemen and civilians had not been identified . \n",

       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national living and working in xxmaj dublin , came to the maternity ward in xxmaj xxunk to give birth on 18 xxmaj february 2002 . xxmaj on that occasion she expressed the wish for her admission and her identity to be kept secret . \n",
       "  xxmaj the exercise by any woman of this right , which is enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , is governed by the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 222 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code , as amended by the xxmaj act of 22 xxmaj january 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj it appears from the evidence before the court ... that at least two lengthy interviews were held in order to explain to this woman the conditions and effects of anonymous registration of a birth . xxmaj these interviews took place in the presence of xxmaj english speakers , and xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , who chose to come to xxmaj france to give birth , can not expect the social services to have offered anything more in this respect , particularly not the presence of an official interpreter , which is not provided for or required by any statutory instrument . xxmaj furthermore , it appears from the proceedings ... and from the written submissions summarising her counsel ’s address ... that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was taken to hospital by a lawyer ; she had therefore clearly sought legal advice prior to the birth . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , no matter what psychological state the applicant may have been in , like any woman opting to give birth in these circumstances , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk was nevertheless fully aware of both the immediate and the future implications of her actions and decisions . xxmaj she thus acted quite consciously in having the birth registered anonymously and giving the child up to the social services to be taken into xxmaj state care , and there are no grounds for arguing that her intellectual faculties were impaired or that the consent was invalid in any way ; moreover , the question of consent is not applicable from a civil - status perspective . \n",
       "  xxmaj in addition , as regards the formal propriety of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , once a child is entrusted to the social services , the latter assume a number of obligations , including the provision of information ... xxmaj it appears from the record of the child ’s placement , which contains entries whose existence is not disputed , that the social services fulfilled their obligation to provide information on a child ’s placement in xxmaj state care and the ensuing legal effects . xxmaj such information was , moreover , provided in xxmaj english , and the notice and model letter requesting the return of the child were indeed given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk fully understood the meaning and scope of this information since she left documents for the child in the event that the latter expressed the wish to discover her origins at a future date . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk clearly expressed her wish that the child should never be able to have legal ties to her . xxmaj moreover , she did not withdraw her consent within the two - month period . xxmaj it should be noted in this connection that this right is strictly personal ; accordingly , no action by a third person may be treated as an action to withdraw consent , that being the sole prerogative of the mother , or interrupt the relevant period . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , there are no grounds for declaring null and void the record of 19february 2002 , which served as an entirely valid basis for the placement in xxmaj state care ( first provisionally and later with final effect ) of the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 with no established parentage ... \n",
       "  xxmaj since the mother did not apply for the return of the child within two months after giving her up , the child , who has no legally established parentage , was able to be placed with foster parents by the xxmaj state authorities with a view to her adoption under xxmaj article 351 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj such placement for adoption , by virtue of the provisions of xxmaj article 352 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , constitutes a bar not only to the return of the child to the mother but also to any declaration of filiation or recognition . xxmaj the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared ineffective . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk further alleges a violation of xxmaj articles 13 and 14 of the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights . \n",
       "  xxmaj as stated above , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk gave birth ... while wishing to keep the birth and her identity secret , a right enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and given effect by the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj more generally , these xxmaj articles govern the conditions for giving up a child , for consent to adoption or for anonymous registration of a birth , as well as the conditions and procedures applicable in the event of repudiation and / or withdrawal of any of these measures . \n",
       "  xxmaj they strike a delicate balance between the rights of a mother , which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , to give birth anonymously with the consequences that entails , and the rights of the foster parents and of the child , whose rights are now framed in such a way as to allow him or her access to more information , if he or she so desires , but in whose interests stability and certainty , both psychological and legal , must be sought , if only through the shortness of the time within which the natural parents may avail themselves of the appropriate procedures . \n",
       "  xxmaj the instant case thus can not be said to involve any discrimination or deprivation of the enjoyment of a right secured to the mother or the child by the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights , or indeed our national law , within the meaning of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj similarly , no matter how short they are , time - limits do exist in xxmaj french law for bringing an action in the ordinary courts , constituting , within the meaning of xxmaj article 13 of the xxmaj convention ... , an effective remedy before a national authority independent of the administrative authority that may be required to rule on an application for the return of a child or to approve an adoption . ” \n",
       "  22.the applicant appealed . xxmaj in a judgment of 22 xxmaj september 2003 the xxmaj douai xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal set aside the first - instance judgment . xxmaj after reiterating the content of the record of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , and in particular the information it provided , the court held : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj paragraph 3 of the section on information thus expressly mentions the existence of two time - limits for the child ’s return without any further formalities , one being two months ( the only possible limit that could apply in the instant case ) , the other being six months , where the second parent has not entrusted the child to the social services . \n",
       "  xxmaj this six - month time - limit is mentioned on two further occasions , firstly in relation to the right to have the child returned to the second parent and secondly in indicating that even after the expiry of the two - month and six - month periods , a court action may still be brought . \n",
       "  xxmaj this information could have misled xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... since in reality the six - month time - limit applicable under xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code in the circumstances referred to in xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 did not apply in the instant case , there being no established paternity as the mother had registered the birth anonymously , and the placement therefore came under point ( 1 ) of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national who is a native xxmaj english speaker and does not speak xxmaj french , could not have known the consequences in xxmaj french law of anonymous registration of the birth , in terms of her rights and those of the biological father , and the information given was in no way capable of xxunk her in a clear and precise manner . \n",
       "  xxmaj having been informed of the existence of a six - month time - limit where ‘ the child has a second parent who did not entrust him or her to the service’ , she may legitimately have thought , in the light of the information set out in the record , that this time - limit was applicable in her case since she had on several occasions notified the local health and social services department of the existence of a biological father who had not been informed of the placement procedure . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will be observed that there is no mention in the record that an interpreter was present when it was signed and that it has not been disputed that a member of the maternity ward staff assisted with the translation and the explanation in xxmaj english of the information given in xxmaj french to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... xxmaj however , a translation of this nature , which was provided by a person who used xxmaj english only occasionally and did not have specific legal knowledge , and which , moreover , was based on particularly ambiguous information as to the time - limits , did not enable xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... to have access to proper information about her rights regarding the procedures for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj it therefore appears that the information provided to the appellant concerning the right to have the child returned was inaccurate or at least particularly ambiguous , and was set out in a pre - printed document not specially adapted to the procedure of anonymous birth registration but designed for use in any of the circumstances covered by xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code for the taking of a child into xxmaj state care ; that reference was made to a six - month time - limit not applicable in her case ; and that , moreover , being an native xxmaj english speaker , the mother was not effectively informed of the procedures for the return of her child and of the strict two - month time - limit that applied in her case . \n",
       "  xxmaj furthermore , it has not been shown in any way that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... otherwise received any clear information before the record was signed as to her right to recover the child . \n",
       "  xxmaj the note by xxmaj ms xxup f. – who also drew up the record in issue – besides having no evidential value , since it was written by a party to the proceedings , does not contain any clarification as to the information given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... about the time - limit for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , the fact that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... was in contact with a xxmaj french lawyer prior to the birth does not mean that she received precise information from him about the exclusive nature of the two - month time - limit ... \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk belief ... in the possibility of recovering the child within a six - month period is corroborated by the request she made in person on 25 and 26 xxmaj july 2002 to the xxmaj nord health and social services department , citing this time - limit , and by the subsequent letters from her lawyer , which also state that his client thought that she could take her child back within such a period . \n",
       "  xxmaj having regard to all these considerations , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... placed her child in xxmaj state care while believing – legitimately , in view of the ambiguous information she had received when signing the record of the placement – that she could take her back within a period of six months and that this time - limit also applied to xxmaj mr xxup b. , who had , moreover , instituted proceedings in xxmaj ireland on 9april 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj this error as to the time - limit for the return of the child concerns a significant element of her consent to the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care , especially as the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 5 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code require precise information on the subject to be given to the mother . \n",
       "  xxmaj in these circumstances , the application for the record of the child ’s placement of 19february 2002 to be declared null and void must be allowed . \n",
       "  ... seeing that the handing over of the child to the xxmaj state authorities was rendered void by a lack of true consent affecting the validity of the record drawn up on 19february 2002 , the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care is to be retrospectively annulled and can not therefore have any legal effect . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , the application for the child to be returned to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... should be allowed , without there being any need to address the subsidiary arguments she submitted in support of that application . \n",

       "  8.the applicant was convicted on 21 xxmaj february 2007 , at the age of twenty , of two counts of possession of xxmaj class a drugs with intent to supply . xxmaj he pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in 2005 , in which the applicant had been shot . xxmaj he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment , and on 18october 2007 was notified of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s intention to deport him . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom since the age of three . xxmaj his aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at the age of five , and the first official record of his presence was when he was eight years old . xxmaj even allowing for his long stay in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , only four years had been with valid leave . xxmaj it was believed that he was in contact with his mother , who remained in xxmaj nigeria , and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority , the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances . xxmaj it was not accepted that he had family life in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  9.the applicant appealed against the decision to deport him and his appeal was dismissed by the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal on 13march 2008 . xxmaj the xxmaj tribunal noted the applicant ’s previous criminal record : he had been convicted of possession of xxmaj class a and xxmaj class b drugs in xxmaj february 2004 ; handling stolen goods in xxmaj april 2004 ; and possession of xxmaj class c drugs in xxmaj june 2005 . \n",

       "  21.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test . xxmaj it required firstly , that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity . xxmaj secondly , there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj the court also found , thirdly , that because of the “ foreign ” nature of expulsion cases , the threshold for what would meet the threshold of xxmaj article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving xxmaj state but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness . xxmaj fourthly , a risk of suicide could , in principle , form the basis of a successful claim under xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj fifthly , an important factor in determining whether removal would breach xxmaj article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill - treatment in the receiving xxmaj state , if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide , was objectively well - founded . a fear found not to be objectively well - founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj finally , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and / or receiving xxmaj states had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide . xxmaj the existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of xxmaj article 3 as a result of removal . \n",
       "  22.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages , namely , in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , in transit , and in the receiving xxmaj state . xxmaj the threshold for xxmaj article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving xxmaj state was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in the case of the particular appellant , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal found that the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities ; that the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state would provide appropriately qualified xxunk and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport ; and that in light of the finding that the applicant ’s fears of return to xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka were not objectively well - founded , and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that xxmaj state , the risk of suicide in xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka would not reach the very high threshold of xxmaj article 3 . \n",

       "  12.on 27 xxmaj december 1991 the xxmaj director of the xxmaj warsaw xxmaj district xxmaj office refused to return the plots to the applicants and to grant them the right to their perpetual use . xxmaj he stated that it had been established during the proceedings that in 1947 the applicants’ predecessor in title had submitted an application for temporary ownership of the plots , which had then been listed in the xxmaj warsaw xxmaj land xxmaj register under entries nos . 415 and xxunk . xxmaj this application had remained unanswered , but the administrative authority had duly examined it in the course of the current proceedings . xxmaj it was established that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at 70 to 75 % during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war , as was pointed out in a letter of the xxmaj regional xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj historical xxmaj monuments of 28 xxmaj november 1991 . xxmaj the palace had subsequently been rebuilt by the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture . xxmaj thus it had been the xxmaj state xxmaj treasury which had borne the costs of rebuilding the palace . xxmaj accordingly , restitution of the property concerned would have been unjustified , and the administrative authority found no grounds on which the 1947 application and the request lodged by the applicants in 1990 should be granted . \n",
       "  13.the applicants lodged an appeal against that decision . xxmaj they argued that the decision was not in conformity with the applicable laws , in particular as the first - instance authority had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the palace had indeed been destroyed during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war . xxmaj they also complained that no sound arguments had been advanced in the decision to show that restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its public use . \n",
       "  14.on 27 xxmaj february 1992 the xxmaj governor ’s xxmaj office rejected the applicants’ appeal , finding that it had been lodged one day after the expiration of the fourteen - day time - limit provided for in the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure . \n",
       "  15.the applicants filed an appeal with the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court . xxmaj they argued that the appeal had been posted on 20 xxmaj january 1992 , that is on the last day of the time - limit , as was shown by a post - office receipt . xxmaj the fact that the postmark on the envelope was dated 21 xxmaj january 1992 was due exclusively to the incomprehensible negligence of the postal services and could not be held against the applicants . \n",
       "  16.on 24 xxmaj july 1992 the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court quashed the decision appealed against , considering that it was not established that the applicants had lodged their appeal against the decision of 27 xxmaj december 1991 outside the time - limit provided for by the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure , in particular because the applicants had submitted the post - office receipt to the court , showing clearly that their appeal had been posted on 20january 1992 . \n",
       "  17.on 9 xxmaj september 1993 the xxmaj office of the xxmaj governor of xxmaj warsaw , having examined the applicants’ appeal of 20 xxmaj january 1992 , upheld the decision of 27december 1991 . xxmaj it pointed out that the administrative authority had established that the property of the applicants’ predecessor - in - title had been designated by relevant land - development plans adopted in 1947 , 1983 and 1992 for use by the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture and xxmaj arts . xxmaj that designation had not been changed by any subsequent decision , as was certified by a letter of 19august 1993 from the xxmaj director of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration xxmaj department of the xxmaj warsaw xxmaj district xxmaj office . xxmaj the xxmaj governor further held that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at 70 to 75 % during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war , as was certified by a letter of the xxmaj regional xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj historical xxmaj monuments of 28 xxmaj november 1991 . xxmaj the palace had been rebuilt in the late 1940s by the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture and xxmaj arts . xxmaj as it had been the xxmaj state xxmaj treasury that had borne the rebuilding costs , it had acquired ownership of the property concerned . xxmaj moreover , at the time when xxmaj roman xxmaj potocki had lodged the application for temporary ownership , the buildings on the plot had not existed , as they had been destroyed . xxmaj the administrative authority concluded that , in the light of the above considerations , granting the applicants the right to perpetual use would be unjustified . \n",
       "  18.on 12 xxmaj october 1993 the applicants lodged an appeal with the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court against that judgment , complaining that the impugned decision was not in conformity with applicable substantive law . xxmaj they first submitted that the decision was in breach of xxmaj article 7 of the 1945 decree in that the administrative authorities had failed to establish with sufficient clarity that the applicants’ intentions as to the future use of the palace had not been compatible with the local land - development plan . xxmaj the applicants emphasised that the authorities had disregarded their argument that they did not plan to alter the public nature of the palace . xxmaj they had only wanted to reserve a small part of it for their exclusive use , whereas the remainder would be used for cultural and leisure purposes and would be accessible to the general public . xxmaj therefore , no issue arose , in fact , regarding the designation of the property for public use as its use was to remain unchanged . xxmaj moreover , the authorities had failed to indicate why the restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its continued public use . \n",
       "  19.the applicants further stressed that the authorities had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the buildings on the plots had been destroyed during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war and subsequently rebuilt by the xxmaj state , and that they should therefore be considered the xxmaj state ’s property . xxmaj the findings made in this respect were superficial and based on insufficient evidence . xxmaj the applicants emphasised in particular that the letter from the xxmaj regional xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj historical xxmaj monuments of 28 xxmaj november 1991 could not reasonably be regarded as credible , as the xxunk operated under the supervision of the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture and thus could not be expected to act against the ministry ’s interests . xxmaj in view of that flaw , the authorities should have requested a report by an expert on construction technology in order to verify the information in the xxunk ’s letter . xxmaj in conclusion , the applicants requested that the decision under appeal should be set aside and that the case should be re - examined . \n",
       "  20.the applicants submitted that xxmaj articles 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 35 1 and 3 , 75 1 , 77 1 , 78 1 and 107 3 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure had been breached in the course of the proceedings and that those procedural shortcomings had had a bearing on the outcome of the case . \n",
       "  21.on an unspecified date a hearing was held before the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court in the appeal proceedings . xxmaj the applicants’ lawyer submitted that their application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 was to be seen both as a reiterated application for temporary ownership , lodged in 1947 , and as a new application for restitution of the property concerned and for having a right to perpetual use of the land awarded . \n",
       "  22.by a judgment of 22 xxmaj june 1995 the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court rejected the applicants’ appeal in so far as it concerned the application for temporary ownership , which had been submitted by xxmaj roman xxmaj potocki in 1947 . xxmaj in doing so , the court recalled that , pursuant to xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court xxmaj act of 31 xxmaj january 1980 , as amended , it was not competent to deal with appeals against administrative decisions given in cases in which proceedings had been instituted before 1 xxmaj september 1980 . xxmaj accordingly , the court could not review the lawfulness of that part of the contested second - instance administrative decision , given that the relevant proceedings had been instituted in 1947 . \n",
       "  23.in so far as the decision under appeal concerned the applicants’ application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 for restitution of their former property and for the right to perpetual use of the land under the provisions of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act of 1985 , the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court first considered that the authorities had failed to show why restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with public use of the plot and the palace , and had therefore breached xxmaj article 107 3 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure , under which an administrative authority , when issuing a decision , was required to point out the facts on which it had relied , to refer to evidence which had served as a basis for its factual findings , and to indicate the grounds on which other evidence had not been considered credible . \n",
       "  xxmaj the court further considered that despite those procedural shortcomings the decision under appeal had , in any event , been lawful . xxmaj the court noted that the crux of that part of the case was to assess whether the applicants could , under the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act of 1985 , claim to have a right to perpetual use of the plots concerned conferred on them by way of compensation for the expropriation carried out under the 1945 decree . \n",
       "  xxmaj the court observed that under section xxunk ) of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act , a right to perpetual use of land could only be conferred in cases where real property was given back to its former owners . xxmaj however , that entitlement had been limited to certain categories of real property , namely one - family houses or small apartment blocks . xxmaj the property concerned in the present case did not belong to any of those categories . xxmaj moreover , the 1985 xxmaj act had laid down a time - limit for the submission of such claims , and that limit had expired on 31 xxmaj december 1988 . xxmaj the applicants’ application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 to have their former property restored to them and for the right to perpetual use of the property had been lodged outside that time - limit . xxmaj accordingly , the restitution could not have been ordered . xxmaj the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court therefore dismissed the remainder of the applicants’ appeal . \n",

       "  a.introduction \n",
       "  7.the applicant was born in 1960 near xxmaj bethlehem , then administered as part of the xxmaj kingdom of xxmaj jordan . xxmaj he arrived in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom in xxmaj september 1993 , having previously fled xxmaj jordan and gone to xxmaj pakistan . xxmaj he made a successful application for asylum , the basis of which was first , that he had been detained and tortured in xxmaj march 1988 and 1990 - 1991 by the xxmaj jordanian authorities and second , that he had been detained and later placed under house arrest on two further occasions . xxmaj the applicant was recognised as a refugee on 30 xxmaj june 1994 and granted leave to remain until 30june 1998 . xxmaj as is the normal practice , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state did not give reasons for his decision for recognising the applicant as a refugee . \n",
       "  8.on 8 xxmaj may 1998 the applicant applied for indefinite leave to remain in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj this application had not been determined before the applicant ’s arrest on 23 xxmaj october 2002 . xxmaj on that date he was taken into detention under the xxmaj anti - terrorism , xxmaj crime and xxmaj security xxmaj act 2001 ( see xxmaj a.and xxmaj others v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom [ xxup gc ] , no . 3455 / 05 , 90 , 19 xxmaj february 2009 ) . xxmaj when that xxmaj act was repealed in xxmaj march 2005 , the applicant was released on bail and then made subject to a control order under the xxmaj prevention of xxmaj terrorism xxmaj act 2005 ( ibid . , 83 and 84 ) . xxmaj on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , while his appeal against that control order was still pending , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with a notice of intention to deport ( see section 3 , paragraph 25 below ) . \n",
       "  b.previous criminal proceedings in xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  1.the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge xxmaj trial \n",
       "  9.in xxmaj april 1999 , the applicant was convicted in absentia in xxmaj jordan of conspiracy to cause explosions , in a trial known as the “ reform and challenge ” case . xxmaj he was the twelfth of thirteen defendants . \n",
       "  10.the case involved an allegation of a conspiracy to carry out bombings in xxmaj jordan , which resulted in successful attacks on the xxmaj american xxmaj school and the xxmaj jerusalem xxmaj hotel in xxmaj amman in 1998 . xxmaj there were further convictions for offences of membership of a terrorist group , but these matters were the subject of a general amnesty . xxmaj the applicant was sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour at the conclusion of the trial . \n",
       "  11.during the trial , one witness , xxmaj mohamed xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine , confessed that he and not the defendants had been involved in the bombings . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court hearing the case took the view that his confession was false , and demonstrably so , because of discrepancies between what he said about the nature of the explosives , for example , and other technical evidence . mral - xxmaj jeramaine was later executed for homicides for which he had been convicted in another trial . \n",
       "  12.the applicant maintains that the evidence against him was predominantly based upon an incriminating statement from a co - defendant , xxmaj abdul xxmaj nasser xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher ( also known as xxmaj al - xxmaj khamayseh ) . xxmaj in his confession to the xxmaj public ( or xxmaj state ) xxmaj prosecutor , xxmaj mr xxmaj al - xxmaj hamasher alleged that the applicant had provided prior encouragement for the attacks . xxmaj he was also said to have congratulated the group after the attacks . \n",
       "  13.mr xxmaj al xxmaj hamasher , along with several other defendants , had complained during the proceedings before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court that they had been tortured by the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj general xxmaj intelligence xxmaj directorate ( “ the xxup gid ” ) , which shares responsibility for maintaining internal security and monitoring security threats in xxmaj jordan with the xxmaj public xxmaj security xxmaj directorate and the military . xxmaj at the end of the period of interrogation during which they claimed to have been tortured , the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor took a statement from each defendant . \n",
       "  14.at the trial there was evidence from lawyers and medical examiners and relatives of the defendants that there were visible signs of torture on the defendants . xxmaj however , the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court concluded that the defendants could not prove torture . \n",
       "  15.there were a number of appeals to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and remittals back to the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , although , as the applicant had been convicted in absentia , no appeals were taken on his behalf . xxmaj in the course of those appeals , the convictions were upheld on the basis that the relevant statements had been made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the confessions in those statements thus constituted sufficient evidence for conviction if the court accepted them and if the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was satisfied with the confessions . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected the claim that the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor had to prove that the defendants had confessed to him of their own accord : the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor ’s obligation to prove that a confession was obtained willingly only arose where the confession had not been obtained by him . xxmaj the confessions in question were authentic and there was no evidence that they had been made under financial or moral coercion . \n",
       "  16.the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation then considered the impact of the allegations that the confessions to the xxmaj state xxmaj prosecutor had resulted from coercion of the defendants and their families while they were in xxup gid detention . xxmaj such conduct during an investigation was against xxmaj jordanian law and rendered the perpetrators liable to punishment . xxmaj however , even assuming that the defendants’ allegations were true , that would not nullify the confessions made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor unless it were proved that those confessions were the consequence of illegal coercion to force the defendants to confess to things which they had not done . xxmaj the defendants had not shown that was the case . \n",
       "  17.as a result of the applicant ’s conviction in this trial , the xxmaj jordanian authorities requested the applicant ’s extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in early 2000 , the request was withdrawn by xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  2.the millennium conspiracy trial \n",
       "  18.in the autumn of 2000 the applicant was again tried in absentia in xxmaj jordan , this time in a case known as the “ millennium conspiracy ” , which concerned a conspiracy to cause explosions at western and xxmaj israeli targets in xxmaj jordan to coincide with the millennium celebrations . xxmaj the conspiracy was uncovered before the attacks could be carried out . xxmaj the applicant was alleged to have provided money for a computer and encouragement through his writings , which had been found at the house of a co - defendant , mrabuhawsher . xxmaj the applicant maintains that the main evidence against him was the testimony of xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher . \n",
       "  19.most of the defendants were convicted on most charges ; some were fully or partly acquitted . xxmaj the applicant was convicted and sentenced to 15years’ imprisonment with hard labour . xxmaj other defendants , including abuhawsher , were sentenced to death . xxmaj on appeal certain of the defendants , including , it appears , xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , claimed to have been tortured during 50days of interrogation when they were denied access to lawyers . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation rejected this ground of appeal , holding that the minutes of interrogation showed that each defendant had been told of his right to remain silent about the charges unless their lawyer was present . xxmaj the applicant also states that the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation found that the alleged ill - treatment in xxup gid custody was irrelevant because the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court did not rely on the defendants’ confessions to the xxup gid but their confessions to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher remains under sentence of death . \n",
       "  20.the findings of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj special xxmaj immigration xxmaj appeals xxmaj commission ( xxup siac ) in respect of the evidence presented at each trial are set out at paragraph 45 below . xxmaj the further evidence which has become available since xxup siac ’s findings , and which has been submitted to this xxmaj court , is summarised as paragraphs 94–105 below . \n",
       "  c.the agreement of a memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan \n",
       "  21.in xxmaj october 2001 , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office advised the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government that xxmaj article 3 of the xxmaj convention precluded the deportation of terrorist suspects to xxmaj jordan . xxmaj in xxmaj march 2003 , after a xxmaj government review of the possibility of removing such barriers to removal , the xxmaj foreign and xxmaj commonwealth xxmaj office confirmed that its advice of xxmaj october 2001 remained extant but that it was considering whether key countries would be willing and able to provide the appropriate assurances to guarantee that potential deportees would be treated in a manner consistent with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ’s obligations . xxmaj in xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj foreign xxmaj secretary agreed that seeking specific and credible assurances from foreign governments , in the form of memoranda of understanding , might be a way of enabling deportation from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  22.in xxmaj november 2003 , the xxmaj british xxmaj embassy in xxmaj amman was instructed to raise the idea of a framework memorandum of understanding ( xxup mou ) with the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj in xxmaj february 2005 , after meetings between the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister of the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan , and between the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj foreign xxmaj minister , agreement was reached on the principle of an xxup mou . \n",
       "  23.further negotiations took place in xxmaj june 2005 and an xxup mou was signed on 10 xxmaj august 2005 . xxmaj that xxup mou set out a series of assurances of compliance with international human rights standards , which would be adhered to when someone was returned to one xxmaj state from the other ( see paragraph 76 below ) . xxmaj the same day , a side letter from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj charg d’affaires , xxmaj amman , to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior was signed , which recorded the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government ’s ability to give assurances in individual cases that the death penalty would not be imposed . xxmaj in respect of the applicant , further questions as to the conduct of any retrial he would face after deportation were also put to the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and answered in xxmaj may 2006 by the xxmaj legal xxmaj adviser at the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj ministry of xxmaj foreign xxmaj affairs . \n",
       "  24.the xxup mou also made provision for any person returned under it to contact and have prompt and regular visits from a representative of an independent body nominated jointly by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordanian xxmaj governments . xxmaj on 24 xxmaj october 2005 , the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre for xxmaj human xxmaj rights xxmaj studies ( “ the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ” ) signed a monitoring agreement with the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government . xxmaj on 13 xxmaj february 2006 , the terms of reference for the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre were agreed ( see paragraph 80 below ) . \n",
       "  d.the applicant ’s appeal against deportation \n",
       "  25.on 11 xxmaj august 2005 , that is , the day after the xxup mou was signed , the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state served the applicant with the notice of intention to deport . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state certified that the decision to deport the applicant was taken in the interests of national security . xxmaj the applicant appealed to xxup siac against that decision arguing , inter alia , that it was incompatible with xxmaj articles 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj relying on his previous asylum claim , he argued that his high profile would mean he would be of real interest to the xxmaj jordanian authorities . xxmaj if returned , he would also face retrial for the offences for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would thus face lengthy pre - trial detention ( in breach of xxmaj article 5 ) and , if convicted , would face a long term of imprisonment . xxmaj all these factors meant he was at real risk of torture , either pre - trial or after conviction , to obtain a confession from him or to obtain information for other reasons . xxmaj he was also at risk of the death penalty or rendition to other countries , such as the xxmaj united xxmaj states of xxmaj america . xxmaj relying on xxmaj article 6 , he alleged that his retrial would be flagrantly unfair : the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , a military court , lacked independence from the executive and there was a real risk that evidence obtained by torture – either of him , his co - defendants or other prisoners – would be admitted against him . \n",
       "  1.proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  ( a)the conduct of proceedings before xxup siac and its national security findings \n",
       "  26.the applicant ’s appeal was dismissed by xxup siac on 26 xxmaj february 2007 . xxmaj the appeal had been heard by xxup siac in two parts : an “ open session ” , where the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case and evidence was presented in the presence of the applicant and his representatives , and a “ closed session ” where parts of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case which could not be disclosed for security reasons were presented ( see paragraph 69 below ) . xxup siac heard evidence in closed session relating to the process by which the xxup mou had been agreed , the extent to which it would mitigate the risk of torture and also evidence as to the national security threat the applicant was alleged to have posed to the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom ( “ closed material ” ) . xxmaj in the closed sessions , the applicant and his representatives were excluded but his interests were represented by special advocates . xxup siac then delivered an “ open judgment ” , which is publicly available , and a “ closed judgment ” , which was given only to the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state and the special advocates . \n",
       "  27.in reaching its decision as to whether the applicant ’s deportation was necessary in the interests of national security , xxup siac considered the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s case to be “ well proved ” since the applicant was regarded by many terrorists as a spiritual adviser whose views legitimised acts of violence . xxmaj however , xxup siac did not take into account either of the applicant ’s xxmaj jordanian convictions in absentia , which were originally advanced as part of the xxmaj government ’s case . xxmaj the reason for this was that the xxmaj government had adopted what was described as a “ pragmatic approach ” in withdrawing reliance upon any evidence which it was alleged might have been obtained by torture on the grounds that it would require an investigation as to whether it was obtained by torture . xxmaj this was done in accordance the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords’ ruling in xxup a. and others ( no . 2 ) to that effect ( see paragraphs 136 and 137 below ) . \n",
       "  xxup 28.siac then reviewed the evidence it had heard from various sources including a senior xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom diplomat , xxmaj mr xxmaj mark xxmaj oakden , who gave evidence on the negotiation of the xxup mou , the monitoring agreement with the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre and on the risk faced by the applicant in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj on behalf of the applicant , it heard evidence on the xxmaj jordanian regime from three academics . xxmaj it also received evidence from an xxmaj arabic speaking barrister , msrana xxmaj refahi , who had travelled to xxmaj jordan to conduct research on the previous two trials including interviews with the defendants and their lawyers . xxmaj additionally , it considered evidence of the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government ’s interest in the applicant and allegations that a xxmaj jordanian national had been the subject of extraordinary rendition from xxmaj jordan to the xxmaj united xxmaj states . \n",
       "  ( b)siac ’s findings on the xxup mou \n",
       "  xxup 29.siac found that this xxmaj court ’s judgments in xxmaj chahal v. the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , 15 xxmaj november 1996 , xxmaj reports of xxmaj judgments and xxmaj decisions xxup 1996v and xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov v. xxmaj turkey [ xxup gc ] , nos . 46827 / 99 and 46951 / 99 , xxup echr xxup 2005i , showed that reliance could lawfully be placed on assurances ; but the weight to be given depended on the circumstances of each case . xxmaj there was a difference between relying on an assurance which required a xxmaj state to act in a way which would not accord with its normal law and an assurance which required a xxmaj state to adhere to what its law required but which might not be fully or regularly observed in practice . xxmaj referring to a decision of the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture , xxmaj agiza v. xxmaj sweden ( see paragraph 147 below ) , where the xxmaj swedish authorities had expelled an xxmaj egyptian national after receiving assurances from xxmaj egypt , xxup siac continued : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the case of xxmaj agiza stands as a clear warning of the dangers of simple reliance on a form of words and diplomatic monitoring . xxmaj there were already warning signs which ought to have alerted the xxmaj swedish authorities to the risks , including the role they had permitted to a foreign intelligence organisation . xxmaj but we note what to us are the crucial differences : the strength , duration and depth of the bilateral relationship between the two countries by comparison with any that has been pointed to between xxmaj sweden and xxmaj egypt ; the way in which the negotiations over the xxup mou have proceeded and the diplomatic assessment of their significance ; the particular circumstances of [ the present applicant ] and xxmaj jordan ; the degree of risk at the various stages , in the absence of the xxup mou , particularly at the early stages of detention which is when the risk from torture by the xxup gid would normally be at its greatest and when the confirmed torture of xxmaj agiza in xxmaj egypt appears to have occurred ; and the speed with which the monitors would be seeking and we believe obtaining access to the xxmaj appellant in those early days . xxmaj the xxmaj swedes felt that to seek to see xxmaj agiza would betray a want of confidence in the xxmaj egyptians , whereas there is no such feeling in either the xxup uk , the [ xxmaj adaleh ] xxmaj centre or the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government . xxmaj quite the reverse applies . xxmaj one aspect of that case which also troubled the [ xxmaj committee xxmaj against xxmaj torture ] was that xxmaj agiza had been removed without final judicial determination of his case . xxmaj that would not be the position here . ” \n",
       "  30.in the present case , the political situation in xxmaj jordan and the freedom , albeit limited , of non - governmental organisations , the press and xxmaj parliament to express concerns would reduce the risks the applicant faced . xxmaj in addition , the level of scrutiny xxmaj jordan had accepted under the xxup mou could not but show that it was willing to abide by its terms and spirit . xxmaj each country had a real interest in preventing breaches of the xxup mou : the diplomatic relationship between the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and xxmaj jordan was friendly and long - standing and of real value to xxmaj jordan and it would have a real incentive to avoid being seen as having broken its word . xxmaj both countries had an interest in maintaining co - operation on counter - terrorism matters . xxmaj the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom had a very real concern that it should be able to remove foreign nationals without breaching their rights under xxmaj article 3 , so failure in such a highly publicised case would be a major setback for that process . xxmaj that concern would thus act as a further incentive to investigate any breaches of the xxup mou . xxmaj while the xxup mou did not specify what steps would be taken in such an investigation , xxup siac accepted evidence from the xxmaj mr xxmaj oakden that any failure of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to respond to diplomatic queries would lead to “ rapidly escalating diplomatic and xxmaj ministerial contacts and reactions ” . \n",
       "  xxup 31.siac accepted that there were some weaknesses in the xxup mou and monitoring provisions . xxmaj some protections , such as prompt access to a lawyer , recorded interviews , independent medical examinations and prohibition on undisclosed places of detention , were not explicitly present but , in reality , most of these aspects were covered . xxmaj there was no guarantee that access to the applicant , as required by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s terms of reference , would always be granted but any refusal would be brought to light quite quickly ; in the early period of detention , the xxmaj centre was expected to visit the applicant three times a week . xxup siac also expected the xxup gid and the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government to react swiftly to any approach by the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom were a visit to be refused . xxmaj it was “ disturbing ” that the xxmaj united xxmaj nations xxmaj special xxmaj rapporteur on xxmaj torture had been refused access to a xxup gid facility in xxmaj june 2006 , despite a prior arrangement that he would be permitted free access . xxmaj however , on the evidence it had heard , xxup siac found that there was no real risk of ill - treatment of the applicant by the xxup gid . xxmaj there was a weakness in the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre ’s “ relative inexperience and scale ” ; it would be undertaking a task which would be new to it ; and it did not have the expertise among its staff , as it had recognised . xxmaj it was a fairly new body with limited resources and staff , although this could be overcome and the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government would bear the cost . xxmaj it was the very fact of monitoring visits which was important and the absence of specialist expertise was not fatal to their value . \n",
       "  ( c)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 3 \n",
       "  32.the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom xxmaj government did not contest the general thrust of the available material in relation to xxmaj jordan ’s human rights record and , in xxup siac ’s view , details of human rights violations in xxmaj jordan remained relevant to the assessment of the risk faced by the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj government also took the position that it could not return the applicant to xxmaj jordan , in conformity with its international obligations , in the absence of the particular measures contained in the xxup mou . xxmaj nevertheless , xxup siac found it important to consider the risks faced by the applicant by reference to the likely sequence of events if he were to be returned . xxmaj it found that the xxup mou might not be necessary for each risk but rather reinforce the protection available . \n",
       "  xxup 33.siac accepted that , on return , the applicant would be taken into the custody of the xxup gid and retried on the two charges for which he had been convicted in absentia . xxmaj he would be accompanied by a representative of the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre to his place of detention and be medically examined . xxup siac also accepted that the xxup gid would interrogate the applicant with a view to obtaining a confession for use at trial and for more general intelligence purposes , though xxup siac found it to be speculative that xxup gid would interrogate the applicant about other offences in order to bring further charges against him ; there was no evidence of any other charges outstanding . xxup siac also accepted that the xxmaj united xxmaj states would seek to question the applicant and that this would take place soon after his arrival in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj however , there was no real risk that xxmaj article 3 would be breached before the conclusion of the retrial . \n",
       "  34.there was a real risk of torture or ill - treatment of an “ ordinary xxmaj islamist extremist ” in xxup gid detention before charge since such ill - treatment was widespread and longstanding and there was a climate of impunity and evasion of international monitoring in the xxup gid . xxmaj however , the applicant would be protected by his high profile , by the xxup mou and the monitoring agreement , especially since the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would be “ keen to prove its mettle ” and would itself be subject to the vigilance of other nongovernmental organisations . xxmaj this would also prevent any real risk of the use by the xxup gid of tactics such as last - minute refusals of access , claims that the applicant did not wish to see the monitors or moving him elsewhere without notification . xxmaj access by the xxmaj adaleh xxmaj centre would also prevent the applicant ’s incommunicado detention . \n",
       "  35.the xxup mou would also counteract the climate of impunity prevailing in the xxup gid and toleration of torture by its senior members . xxmaj the xxup mou and the monitoring arrangements were supported at the highest levels in xxmaj jordan – the xxmaj king of xxmaj jordan ’s political power and prestige were behind the xxup mou – so it was reasonable to assume that instructions on how to treat the applicant had been given to the xxup gid and it would be aware that any breaches would not go unpunished . xxmaj moreover , senior members of the xxup gid had participated in the xxup mou negotiations and therefore would know the consequences of any failure to comply . xxmaj even if abuses were normally the work of rogue officers , the specific and unusual position of the applicant and the effect of the xxup mou would lead to senior officers preventing ill - treatment in his case , even if they did so only out of self - interest . \n",
       "  36.questioning by the xxmaj united xxmaj states was not forbidden by the xxup mou and , to xxup siac , it was probable that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj central xxmaj intelligence xxmaj agency would be allowed to question the applicant directly with the xxup gid present . xxmaj however , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would have made clear to the xxmaj united xxmaj states its interests in ensuring that the xxup mou was not breached . xxmaj the xxmaj jordanian authorities and xxmaj united xxmaj states would be careful to ensure that the xxmaj united xxmaj states did not “ overstep the mark ” . xxmaj assuming that the applicant remained in xxup gid custody and was not surrendered to the xxmaj united xxmaj states , there would be no real risk of ill - treatment at the pre - trial stage . xxmaj it was also highly unlikely that the applicant would be placed in any secret xxup gid or xxup cia detention facility in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  37.the same factors applied to any questioning which might take place soon after the conviction or acquittal of the applicant . xxmaj the xxup mou would continue to apply and it would be in the interests of both the xxmaj jordanians and the xxmaj americans to conduct any interrogation at the earliest opportunity rather than wait until after trial . xxmaj the applicant ’s high profile was also found to be “ unlikely to diminish much for some years ” . \n",
       "  38.there was little likelihood of the xxmaj jordanian authorities bringing any subsequent charges which carried the death penalty or seeking the death penalty in respect of the charges for which the applicant was to be retried . xxmaj instead , if he were convicted , the applicant would face a lengthy period of imprisonment . xxmaj there was a real risk of a life sentence in respect of the xxmaj reform and xxmaj challenge conspiracy , although there was a greater prospect that it would be considerably less because of the way in which sentences on the other defendants appeared to have been reduced on appeal , to 4 or 5 years . xxmaj there was no real risk of a life sentence in the millennium conspiracy retrial . xxmaj there was no rule that would prevent a higher sentence being imposed than the 15 year sentence that had been imposed in absentia . xxmaj however , the clear practice was against imposing higher sentences in retrials following initial convictions in absentia and there was no reason why a more unfavourable view would be taken of the applicant when he was present than when he was absent . xxmaj the applicant would serve any sentence in an ordinary prison and not a xxup gid detention facility ; the sentence of hard labour did not connote any additional punishment . xxmaj general conditions would not breach xxmaj article 3 and , although beatings sometimes occurred , there was no evidence that the applicant would be targeted as a political xxmaj islamist prisoner . xxmaj his status would again act to protect him . \n",
       "  39.in respect of rendition , there were “ powerful incentives ” for the xxmaj jordanian and xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj governments not to allow this to happen , not least the real domestic political difficulties this would create for the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj government and the unwillingness of the xxmaj united xxmaj states to destabilise the xxmaj jordanian regime . xxmaj any instances of alleged rendition from xxmaj jordan had involved people of other nationalities or , in one case , of a dual xxup us / xxmaj jordanian national . xxmaj it was also very unlikely that the applicant would be removed to a secret xxup cia facility in xxmaj jordan since this would require the connivance of the xxmaj jordanian authorities contrary to the xxup mou . xxmaj it was also unlikely that the xxmaj united xxmaj states xxmaj government would seek the extradition of the applicant from xxmaj jordan when it had not sought his extradition from the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom and there would be political difficulties for xxmaj jordan to accede to such a request . \n",
       "  ( d)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 5 \n",
       "  40.in relation to the applicant ’s detention following his removal to xxmaj jordan , xxup siac found that the time limits for notifying the legal authorities of an arrest ( 48 hours ) and for bringing formal charges ( 15 days ) were regularly and lawfully extended by the courts at the request of the prosecutor , in stages of up to 15 days to a maximum of 50 days . xxmaj it would therefore be compatible with xxmaj jordanian law for the applicant to be held in detention for 50 days without being physically brought before a court before being charged . xxmaj such extensions were approved by a judicial authority , although not necessarily in the physical presence of the suspect . \n",
       "  xxup 41.siac noted that the xxup mou did not explicitly require that there be no extensions of time beyond the initial 15 day detention but required that a returned person be brought promptly before a judge or other person authorised by law to determine the lawfulness of his detention . xxmaj though “ promptly ” was not defined in the xxup mou , xxup siac found that this part of the xxup mou would be carried out , particularly since this was one of the earliest points at which the xxup mou would be engaged , and that the applicant ’s first appearance before a judicial authority would be within 48 hours . xxmaj it would not breach the xxup mou if the applicant were to be detained for a maximum of 50 days , by means of judicially approved 15 day extensions , or if he were absent when those later decisions were taken . xxmaj however , in reality the total period of 50 days was unlikely to be sought , even without the xxup mou , because the applicant faced a retrial and the case dossiers had already been through the trial and appeal process a number of times . \n",
       "  ( e)siac ’s findings on xxmaj article 6 \n",
       "  42.it was common ground before xxup siac that the applicant ’s previous convictions would be set aside and he would face retrial before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court on the same charges . \n",
       "  43.in addition to his two challenges to the retrial process ( the impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the use of evidence obtained by torture ) the applicant also argued that he would be questioned in detention without the presence of a lawyer by the xxup gid , xxmaj united xxmaj states officials or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj the latter had the power under xxmaj article 64(3 ) of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj criminal xxmaj trial xxmaj procedures xxmaj code to conduct an investigation in the absence of a lawyer “ whenever he [ deemed ] it necessary in order to reveal the truth ” . xxmaj this decision was not subject to review , though xxup siac also noted that a confession before the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor was not admissible unless the individual had been warned that he need not answer questions without his lawyer present . xxup siac thought it unlikely that the applicant would have a lawyer present during questioning by the xxup gid or xxmaj united xxmaj states officials but very likely he would have access to a lawyer for any appearance before a judge or the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj in terms of pre - trial preparation by the defence , the period and facilities available would be less extensive than in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom but nonetheless better than would normally be the case in xxmaj jordan . \n",
       "  44.with regard to the lack of independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court , xxup siac found that the court would consist of three judges , at least two of whom would be legally qualified military officers with no security of tenure . xxmaj the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor would also be a military officer . xxmaj appeal would lie to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , a civilian court , though that court could not hear argument on any unfairness of the trial arising from the military composition of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . \n",
       "  45.as to the potential use of evidence obtained by torture in the applicant ’s retrial , xxup siac found as follows : \n",
       "  “ 418.the xxmaj jordanian legal system , by its terms , does not therefore permit the use of involuntary confession or incriminatory statements . xxmaj there is a judicial examination of allegations of that nature before the evidence is admitted . xxmaj those allegations can themselves be tested by evidence . xxmaj how far those allegations can be practicably tested is affected by certain features of the system . xxmaj the burden of proof for excluding confessions made to the xxmaj prosecutor lies on the defendant . xxmaj there is obvious difficulty in proving prior acts or threats by the xxup gid in the absence of systems for recording questioning , for ensuring the presence of lawyers during questioning , and independent prompt medical examinations . xxmaj there is likely to be considerable reluctance on the part of the xxmaj court to accept that confessions to the xxmaj prosecutor , a common source of evidence , are tainted by ill - treatment . xxmaj the xxmaj court or xxmaj prosecutor does not appear prepared to compel the appearance of xxup gid officials to testify about these allegations . xxmaj there may be a sense that these allegations are made routinely , as a matter of defence strategy . \n",
       "  419.there may well be a greater willingness to test the nature of confessions made only in the course of xxup gid questioning . xxmaj there is some evidence that at least at xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation level , confessions alleged to have been obtained by torture have been excluded , ( though it is not clear whether those were made to the xxup gid or to the xxmaj prosecutor ) . \n",
       "  420.however , the general background evidence and that specific to the two trials in question shows that there is at least a very real risk that the incriminating statements against the [ applicant ] were obtained as a result of treatment by the xxup gid which breached xxmaj article 3 xxup echr ; it may or may not have amounted to torture . xxmaj it is very improbable that those statements would be excluded on the retrial , because the ssct is unlikely to be persuaded that they were so obtained , particularly having already rejected that assertion at the first trials , although the makers could give evidence that they were so obtained and were in fact untrue . ” \n",
       "  xxmaj there was , therefore , a high probability that the past statements made to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor which incriminated the applicant would be admitted . xxup siac further found that those statements would be of considerable , perhaps decisive , importance against him . xxmaj on this aspect of the retrial , xxup siac held : \n",
       "  “ 439.to us , the question comes back to whether or not it is unfair for the burden of proof in xxmaj jordan to lie where it does on this issue ; we do not think that to be unfair in itself . xxmaj however , this burden of proof appears to be unaccompanied by some of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment or means of assisting its proof eg video or other recording of questioning by the xxup gid , limited periods of detention for questioning , invariable presence of lawyers , routine medical examination , assistance from the xxmaj court in calling relevant officials or doctors . xxmaj the decisions are also made by a court which lacks independence and does not appear to examine closely or vigorously allegations of this nature . xxmaj it is taking these points in combination which leads us to conclude that the trial would be likely to be unfair within xxmaj article 6 because of the way the allegations about involuntary statements would be considered . ” \n",
       "  xxup 46.siac concluded that , despite its findings in respect of the independence and impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the real risk of the admission of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 , there would be no flagrant denial of justice under xxmaj article 6 of the xxmaj convention if the applicant were retried in xxmaj jordan . xxup siac stated that the retrial would take place “ within a legally constructed framework covering the court system , the procedural rules and the offences ” , the applicant would be present and it would be in public . xxmaj the dossier from the original trial would be before the retrial court but the applicant could effectively challenge its contents . xxmaj the execution of xxmaj al - xxmaj jeramaine and the difficulty faced by other witnesses , notably xxmaj abu xxmaj hawsher , would not make the retrial unfair . xxup siac concluded : \n",
       "  “ 446.we accept the lack of institutional independence in the ssct . xxmaj the lack of independence for ssct xxmaj judges is in the structure and system . xxmaj there is no evidence as to why particular judges might be chosen for particular cases , or that they are ‘ leaned on’ . xxmaj but the ssct is not a mere tool of the executive : there is sound evidence that it appraises the evidence and tests it against the law , and acquits a number of defendants . xxmaj it has reduced sentences over time . \n",
       "  447.its judges have legal training and are career military lawyers . xxmaj there is a very limited basis beyond that for saying that they would be partial , and that has not been the gravamen of the complaint . xxmaj their background may well make them sceptical about allegations of abuse by the xxup gid affecting statements made to the xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj they may instinctively share the view that allegations of ill - treatment are a routine part of a defence case to excuse the incrimination of others . xxmaj the legal framework is poorly geared to detecting and acting upon allegations of abuse . xxmaj the way in which it approaches the admission of evidence , on the material we have , shows no careful scrutiny of potentially tainted evidence . xxmaj there would be considerable publicity given to the retrial and public trials can encourage greater care and impartiality in the examination of the evidence . xxmaj this would not be a mere show trial , nor were the first trials ; nor would the result be a foregone conclusion , regardless of the evidence . \n",
       "  448.reasons are given for the decisions , and an appeal to the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation is available . xxmaj the fact that such an appeal can not cure the want of structural independence in the ssct is not a reason for discounting its existence in the overall assessment of whether there would be a complete denial of xxmaj article 6 rights . xxmaj this xxmaj court is a civilian court and the evidence of undue executive influence through appointment or removal is quite sparse . xxmaj there is no evidence again as to how its panels are chosen , nor that they are “ leaned on ” by the executive . xxmaj it plainly operates as a corrective to the rulings of the ssct on law and procedure , and is of some relevance to factual matters , even though it does not hear the evidence all over again or have a full factual jurisdiction except on xxmaj prosecutors’ appeals . xxmaj the probable sentences are not wholly disproportionate to the offences . \n",
       "  449.we have discussed at length the approach of the ssct to the admission of statements to a prosecutor allegedly given as a result of prior ill - treatment . xxmaj although we take the view that a contribution of factors would probably make the retrial unfair in that respect , they do not constitute a complete denial of a fair trial . xxmaj the existence of a legal prohibition on the admissibility of such evidence can not be ignored , nor the fact that the ssct would hear evidence relating to the allegations . xxmaj the role of the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation in reviewing and at times overturning the conclusions of the ssct on this issue is material . xxmaj the want of evidential or procedural safeguards to balance the burden of proof , and the probable cast of mind towards statements made to a prosecutor / judge in a civil law system , all within a security court dominated by military lawyers , does not suffice for a complete denial of justice . \n",
       "  450.there is a danger , given the inevitable focus on what is said to be potentially unfair about the retrial , in focussing exclusively on deficiencies when deciding whether there would be a total denial of the right to a fair trial , rather than looking at the picture of the trial as a whole . xxmaj that is what has to be done however and it is that picture as a whole which has led us to our conclusion on this issue . \n",
       "  451.the various factors which would be likely to cause the retrial to breach xxmaj article 6 are to a considerable degree interlinked . xxmaj taking them in the round does not persuade us that there is a real risk of a total denial of the right to a fair trial . ” \n",
       "  47.finally , while there was the real prospect of a long term of imprisonment , this did not alter xxup siac ’s conclusion that the overall nature of the retrial would not be a total denial of the applicant ’s rights . \n",
       "  2.proceedings before the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal \n",
       "  48.the applicant appealed to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , which gave judgment on 9 xxmaj april 2008 , unanimously allowing the appeal in respect of xxmaj article 6 and the risk of the use of evidence obtained contrary to xxmaj article 3 and dismissing it on all other grounds ( [ 2008 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 290 ) . \n",
       "  49.for the applicant ’s complaints under xxmaj article 3 as to the use of closed evidence by xxup siac and the reliance on the assurances in the xxup mou , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal considered it was bound by its previous ruling on these questions in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb ( xxmaj algeria ) , u ( xxmaj algeria ) v. the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state for the xxmaj home xxmaj department [ 2007 ] xxup ewca xxmaj civ 808 , which had found that : ( i ) xxup siac could consider closed evidence on safety on return ; and ( ii ) the relevance of assurances to safety on return was a matter of fact not law and thus it had no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal on that ground . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also rejected the applicant ’s appeals based on xxmaj article 5 , finding that xxup siac was entitled to find as it did . \n",
       "  50.for xxmaj article 6 , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal rejected the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk of a “ flagrant denial of justice ” in his retrial in xxmaj jordan by reason of a lack of independence and or impartiality of the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court : xxup siac had been entitled to find as it did on this point and this conclusion was not altered by the later decision of this xxmaj court in almoayad v. xxmaj germany ( dec . ) , no . 35865 / 03 , 20 xxmaj february 2007 . \n",
       "  51.however , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal accepted the applicant ’s argument that there was a real risk that he would suffer a “ flagrant denial of justice ” by reason of the risk that statements obtained through treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 would be admitted as evidence against him in his retrial . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed : \n",
       "  “ xxup 45.siac understated or misunderstood the fundamental nature in xxmaj convention law of the prohibition against the use of evidence obtained by torture . xxmaj counsel for the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state said that it was no part of his submission to say that if it is clear that a trial will take place on the basis of evidence obtained under torture , whether of the individual themselves , or third parties , that that would not involve flagrant denial of justice . xxmaj accordingly , once xxup siac had found as a fact that there was a high probability that evidence that may very well have been obtained by torture ( xxup siac , 436 ) ; or in respect of which there was a very real risk that it had been obtained by torture or other conduct breaching article 3 ( xxup siac , 437 ) ; would be admitted at the trial of mrothman ; then xxup siac had to be satisfied that such evidence would be excluded or not acted on . xxmaj the grounds relied on by xxup siac for not finding a threatened breach of article 6 in that respect were insufficient . \n",
       "  46.we emphasise that that is not or not primarily a criticism of xxup siac ’s reasoning in terms of rationality , though we do consider additionally that xxup siac ’s conclusions did not follow rationally from its findings of fact . xxmaj rather , our principal finding is that xxup siac erred by applying an insufficiently demanding test to determine the issue of whether article 6 rights would be breached . \n",
       "  ... \n",
       "  48.the use of evidence obtained by torture is prohibited in xxmaj convention law not just because that will make the trial unfair , but also and more particularly because of the connexion of the issue with article 3 , a fundamental , unconditional and non - derogable prohibition that stands at the centre of the xxmaj convention protections . xxmaj as the ecthr put it in 105 of its judgment in xxmaj jalloh v xxmaj germany 44 xxup ehrr 32 : \n",
       "  ‘ incriminating evidence - whether in the form of a confession or real evidence - obtained as a result of acts of violence or brutality or other forms of treatment which can be characterised as torture - should never be relied on as proof of the victim ’s guilt , irrespective of its probative value . xxmaj any other conclusion would only serve to legitimate indirectly the sort of morally reprehensible conduct which the authors of xxmaj art.3 of the xxmaj convention sought to proscribe or , as it was so well put in the xxup us xxmaj supreme xxmaj court ’s judgment in the xxmaj rochin case 342 xxup us 165 , “ to afford brutality the cloak of law”.’ \n",
       "  xxmaj that view , that the use of evidence obtained by torture or ill - treatment is prohibited not just , or indeed primarily , because of its likely unreliability , but rather because the state must stand firm against the conduct that has produced the evidence , is universally recognised both within and outside xxmaj convention law . \n",
       "  xxmaj what is , with respect , a particularly strong statement to that effect , citing a multitude of equally strongly worded authorities , is to be found in 17 of the speech of xxmaj lord xxmaj bingham in a v xxmaj home xxmaj secretary ( xxmaj no2 ) [ 2006 ] 2 xxup ac 221 . \n",
       "  xxup 49.siac was wrong not to recognise this crucial difference between breaches of article 6 based on this ground and breaches of article 6 based simply on defects in the trial process or in the composition of the court . xxmaj rather , in its conclusions in 442452 of its determination ... it treated the possible use of evidence obtained by torture pari passu with complaints about the independence of the court : see in particular xxup siac at 449 - 450 . xxmaj that caused it not to recognise the high degree of assurance that is required in relation to proceedings in a foreign state before a person may lawfully be deported to face a trial that may involve evidence obtained by torture . ” \n",
       "  52.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal noted that xxup siac had reached its conclusion that there would not be a complete denial of justice in relation to the use of evidence obtained by torture by relying on the process , admittedly not wholly satisfactory , before the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court and the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation . xxmaj for the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal that conclusion sat very ill with xxup siac ’s own findings about the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court process , in particular xxup siac ’s own concern as to the difficulties in proving that evidence had been obtained by torture . xxmaj in the opinion of the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , xxup siac ’s concern was “ amply justified by the litany of lack of the basic protections against prior ill - treatment ” in xxmaj jordan . xxmaj it also criticised xxup siac ’s “ disturbing failure ” to give proper weight to the findings as to the defects in the xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj it was not open to xxup siac to conclude on that evidence that the risk of the total denial of justice that is represented by the use of evidence obtained by torture had been adequately excluded . xxup siac could not have so concluded if it had properly understood the status in xxmaj convention law of this aspect of article 6 . ” \n",
       "  3.proceedings before the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords \n",
       "  53.the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state appealed to the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords in relation to the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal ’s conclusion on xxmaj article 6 . xxmaj the applicant cross - appealed in relation to his other xxmaj convention complaints . xxmaj the appeal was heard with the appeals of two of the appellants in xxup mt ( xxmaj algeria ) , xxup rb and u ( see paragraph 48 above ) . xxmaj in the conjoined appeals the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords was therefore able to consider the use of closed material before xxup siac , the reliance on the assurances contained in the xxup mou and the applicant ’s xxmaj articles5 and 6 complaints . xxmaj the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords gave judgment on 18february 2009 unanimously allowing the xxmaj government ’s appeal and dismissing the applicant ’s cross - appeal ( [ 2009 ] xxup ukhl 10 ) . \n",
       "  ( a)article 3 : the “ closed ” proceedings before xxup siac \n",
       "  54.lord xxmaj phillips held that xxup siac was lawfully entitled to consider closed material in evaluating safety on return and there were cogent considerations of policy for doing so . a distinction had to be drawn between closed material on safety on return and the use of closed material in other proceedings , for example to establish the national security threat posed by an individual . xxmaj for the former , the individual would normally be aware of the nature of any risk on return and , in any event , it was for the individual himself , and not the xxmaj state , to make out his case on whether he would be at risk on return . xxmaj it was not likely to be critically important for a special advocate to be able to obtain input from the person to be deported in relation to closed evidence . xxmaj as regards the impracticality of obtaining an appropriate expert witness with security clearance to see the material , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips did not regard the problem as unfair . xxup siac ’s rules of procedure enabled the special advocate to ask xxup siac to call for more evidence and xxup siac , as an expert tribunal , could be relied upon “ to make a realistic appraisal of the closed material in the light of the special advocate ’s submission ” . xxmaj in respect of the assurances , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips endorsed the view that the assurances contained in the xxup mou had to be disclosed but details of the negotiations leading to the xxup mou could be closed material . \n",
       "  55.lord xxmaj hoffmann rejected the applicant ’s argument on the more fundamental basis that he viewed this xxmaj court ’s case - law as making it clear that the determination whether a deportation order might infringe xxmaj article 3 did not require “ the full judicial panoply of article 6 or even 5(4 ) ” . xxmaj citing xxmaj chahal , cited above , he emphasised that all that was required was “ independent scrutiny of the claim ” , which had occurred in the applicant ’s case . \n",
       "  56.lord xxmaj hope agreed , albeit accepting that this xxmaj court had not yet had the opportunity to analyse whether the xxup siac system met the requirements of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj in his view , it did so . xxmaj lord xxmaj brown also agreed , emphasising that with regard to safety on return , no case was being made against the applicant ; rather it was he who was making a case against the returning xxmaj state . \n",
       "  ( b)article 3 : assurances and the xxup mou \n",
       "  57.lord xxmaj phillips ( with whom the other xxmaj law xxmaj lords agreed ) construed the this xxmaj court ’s case - law from xxmaj mamatkulov and xxmaj askarov , cited above , onwards as treating assurances “ as part of the matrix that had to be considered ” when deciding whether there were substantial grounds for believing that the applicant would face treatment contrary to xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj he referred to the “ abundance ” of international law material , which supported the proposition that assurances should be treated with scepticism if they are given by a country where inhuman treatment by xxmaj state agents was endemic . xxmaj however , for xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips this came “ close to a ‘ xxmaj catch 22’ proposition that if you need to ask for assurances you can not rely on them ” . xxmaj in rejecting that proposition , he held that the only basis to interfere with the view of xxup siac was if its conclusions that the assurances could be relied upon were irrational and xxup siac ’s conclusions in the present case were not . \n",
       "  ( c)article 5 \n",
       "  58.the xxmaj house of xxmaj lords unanimously refused to interfere with the finding of fact by xxup siac that the applicant ’s exposure under xxmaj jordanian law to 50 days’ detention without access to a court or a lawyer , would not arise . xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found that , even if it would arise , 50 days’ detention would not constitute a flagrant breach of xxmaj article 5 . a flagrant breach was a breach whose consequences were so severe that they overrode the right of a xxmaj state to expel an alien from its territory . xxmaj that might be satisfied by arbitrary detention which lasted many years but not 50 days’ detention . \n",
       "  ( d)article 6 \n",
       "  59.on xxmaj article 6 , taking the test to be whether there would be a “ complete denial or nullification ” of the right to a fair trial , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips observed : \n",
       "  “ 136.this is neither an easy nor an adequate test of whether article 6 should bar the deportation of an alien . xxmaj in the first place it is not easy to postulate what amounts to ‘ a complete denial or nullification of the right to a fair trial’ . xxmaj that phrase can not require that every aspect of the trial process should be unfair . ... xxmaj what is required is that the deficiency or deficiencies in the trial process should be such as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of the prospective trial . \n",
       "  137.in the second place , the fact that the deportee may find himself subject in the receiving country to a legal process that is blatantly unfair can not , of itself , justify placing an embargo on his deportation . xxmaj the focus must be not simply on the unfairness of the trial process but on its potential consequences . xxmaj an unfair trial is likely to lead to the violation of substantive human rights and the extent of that prospective violation must plainly be an important factor in deciding whether deportation is precluded . ” \n",
       "  60.having reviewed , the relevant case - law of this xxmaj court , including xxmaj bader and xxmaj kanbor v. xxmaj sweden , no . 13284 / 04 , 42 , xxup echr xxup 2005xi , which he took to exemplify the need to consider the risk of a violation of xxmaj article 6 in combination with other xxmaj articles such as xxmaj articles 2 and 3 , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips found : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he xxmaj strasbourg jurisprudence , tentative though it is , has led me to these conclusions . xxmaj before the deportation of an alien will be capable of violating article 6 there must be substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk ( i ) that there will be a fundamental breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by article 6 and ( ii ) that this failure will lead to a miscarriage of justice that itself constitutes a flagrant violation of the victim ’s fundamental rights . ” \n",
       "  61.in the present case , the second limb was met by the potential sentences of imprisonment the applicant faced . xxmaj for the first limb , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips concluded that , although the military constitution of the xxmaj jordanian xxmaj state xxmaj security xxmaj court would render the trial contrary to xxmaj article 6 if it were held in a xxmaj convention xxmaj state , he agreed with xxup siac and the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal , that it could not amount to a “ flagrant denial of justice ” sufficient to prevent deportation in a removal case . \n",
       "  62.in respect of the applicant ’s complaint that there was a real risk that the evidence against him had been obtained by torture , xxmaj lord xxmaj phillips held that the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal erred . xxmaj it had required too high a degree of assurance that evidence that might have been obtained by torture would not be used in a foreign trial . xxmaj he stated : \n",
       "  “ [ xxmaj t]he prohibition on receiving evidence obtained by torture is not primarily because such evidence is unreliable or because the reception of the evidence will make the trial unfair . xxmaj rather it is because ‘ the state must stand firm against the conduct that produced the evidence’ . xxmaj that principle applies to the state in which an attempt is made to adduce such evidence . xxmaj it does not require this state , the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , to retain in this country to the detriment of national security a terrorist suspect unless it has a high degree of assurance that evidence obtained by torture will not be adduced against him in xxmaj jordan ... xxmaj the issue before xxup siac was whether there were reasonable grounds for believing that if xxmaj mr xxmaj othman were deported to xxmaj jordan the criminal trial that he would there face would have defects of such significance as fundamentally to destroy the fairness of his trial or , as xxup siac put it , to amount to a total denial of the right to a fair trial . xxup siac concluded that the deficiencies that xxup siac had identified did not meet that exacting test . i do not find that in reaching this conclusion xxup siac erred in law . ” \n",

       "  xxmaj the reasons given by the judge included the following considerations : \n",
       "  \" a landlord 's need to terminate a lease must be assessed mainly in the light of his family circumstances , his living conditions and / or his occupational status at the time when the action is brought or foreseeable in the immediate future . \n",
       "  xxmaj in that connection , the following facts have already been established : that ' since his marriage , in xxmaj april 1979 , xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto has lived with his parents - in - law in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , [ xxmaj funchal ] ' ; that ' xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , one of xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's brothers and two of her aunts ... lived in the house ' ; that ' the plaintiffs ' house has three bedrooms , a kitchen and a bathroom ' ; that ' the house where the plaintiffs live has four bedrooms on the first floor , a kitchen and a living - cum - dining room on the ground floor and a basement ' ; that ' xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents - in - law , who are at present the sole occupants , with xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto and their son , of the house in the xxmaj travessa do xxmaj caetano , are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' ; and that ' the plaintiffs both work in xxmaj funchal ' . \n",
       "  xxmaj it should be noted that xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's two aunts and her brother no longer live in the house where the plaintiffs are now living and that this has increased the available living space and privacy that all human beings need . xxmaj the plaintiffs ' living conditions are better now than they were when the action was brought , since they even have a bedroom for their son . \n",
       "  xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs did not succeed in proving , as the onus was on them to do , that the relations between themselves and xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents were permanently strained and conflictual . xxmaj what is certain , however , is that no link whatsoever has been established between their son 's illness and their living conditions in that house . \n",
       "  xxmaj it might be said - and after all it has been proved that the plaintiffs live with xxunk xxmaj barreto 's parents , ' who are resigned to the presence in their house of the plaintiffs and their son , since they have nowhere else to live ' - that in view of the xxunk ' xxmaj when a man marries he needs a house ' , cited by xxmaj mr xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto in his first application , the existence of a marriage should be sufficient to establish a need to recover possession of the rented property in order to live there . \n",

       "  xxmaj however , each case is unique . xxmaj regard being had to the facts found to have been established and those asserted by the plaintiffs in support of their claims , but not established , and given that the concept of the need to occupy must be interpreted as a state of necessity , to be objectively assessed on the basis of a reasonable criterion , in the light of everyday experience , it can not be denied that the facts as a whole do not support the conclusion that the plaintiffs need the property in question in order to live there . \n",

       "  xxmaj since it has not been proved that the plaintiffs are in a precarious situation , the fact that they live with xxmaj mrs xxmaj velosa xxmaj barreto 's parents , albeit by their favour , is manifestly insufficient to prove the need required by xxmaj article 1096 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code ... xxmaj moreover , the plaintiffs have not proved that there was tension which made it intolerable for them all to live in the same house . \n",

       "  22.according to a decision by the same prosecutor ’s office dated 20september 1995 , issued in case no . 97 / p / 1990 , the subject - matter of the investigation was specified as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj with regard to the aims of case no . 97 / p / 1990 , it is also necessary to specify the timeframe to be taken into account . xxmaj thus , it should be emphasised that the investigations focused on acts committed during the period which elapsed between the dispersion of the demonstration on xxmaj palace xxmaj square ordered by xxup n. xxmaj ceauşescu on 21december 1989 and the dictator ’s flight during the day of 22december 1989 . ” \n",
       "  23.from 1992 the military prosecutor ’s office issued decisions separating the investigations with regard to several hundred injured parties who had been subjected to violence and wrongful arrest in the course of 21december 1989 . xxmaj for example , the decisions of 5 xxmaj june and 2july 1992 concern the separation of the investigations in respect of xxmaj marius xxup i. and xxmaj sorin xxup b. , who had been beaten by servicemen . xxmaj decisions discontinuing the proceedings were subsequently issued in those cases . xxmaj they were based on legislative decree no . 3 of 4january 1990 , which amnestied certain offences punishable by a sentence of less than three years’ imprisonment . \n",
       "  24.on 20 xxmaj september 1995 prosecutor xxup s. in the military prosecutors’ office at the xxmaj supreme xxmaj court of xxmaj justice issued a decision discontinuing proceedings in case no . 97 / p / 1990 , which concerned persons killed or injured by gunfire . \n",
       "  25.the above - cited decision did not contain an exhaustive list of victims , the number of which it described as “ 130 dead and injured ” ; on the basis of other indications in the same decision , 49 persons were apparently killed and 89 injured by gunshots , including men , women and children – unarmed civilians , of whom only 42 were listed by name . \n",
       "  26.according to the above decision , the events were as follows : following the demonstrations against the authorities , which had begun in xxmaj timişoara , on 17december1989 the then xxmaj minster of xxmaj defence had issued an order to combat the demonstrators ( xxunk de xxunk ) . xxmaj the decision of 20september1995 stated that the above order had been worded as follows : “ xxmaj the armed forces must follow the warning procedure [ using the words ] stop , stop , or i will fire ; in the event of failure to comply with the warning , shots should be fired in the air then , if the warning is still ignored , shots should be fired towards the feet ” . xxmaj the decision of 20september1995 did not specify in what situations an armed intervention was required . \n",
       "  27.the decision further indicated that it had been impossible to establish the exact order of events , given the scale of the confrontation “ between , on the one hand , thousands or tens of thousands of demonstrators and , on the other , hundreds or thousands of servicemen from the security forces ” . xxmaj furthermore , the prosecutor ’s office pointed out that “ after the fall of the totalitarian regime , the xxmaj state institutions suffered from real paralysis , and [ were ] in a general situation of chaos and confusion ” , so that no on - site investigations were conducted , no samples were taken , ballistics reports commissioned or even autopsies conducted on the victims’ corpses . xxmaj equally , it was noted that “ certain institutions , the staff of which had been involved in dispersing the demonstrations , had failed to cooperate or had not given effective assistance in establishing the facts ” . \n",
       "  28.in addition , although 235 persons , some of had sustained gunshot wounds , had been detained and subjected to ill - treatment at the xxmaj bucharest xxmaj police xxmaj department ( xxmaj xxunk capitalei ) , the xxmaj ministry of the xxmaj interior had refused to identify the hierarchical superiors of the police officers who had committed those offences . \n",
       "  29.the decision of 20 xxmaj september 1995 also mentioned that no serviceman or xxmaj state agent had been a victim of violence on that occasion , so that the opening of fire against the unarmed civilian demonstrators had been unlawful . \n",

       "  31.lastly , the decision indicated that it had been possible to identify only a few of the servicemen who had fired on the demonstrators without having received orders to that effect , such as xxmaj general xxup a.c. xxmaj where they had been identified , the criminal proceedings against them had been separated and were the subject of other case files ; they were therefore no longer part of case no . 97 / p / 1990 . \n",

       "  xxmaj in addition , the prosecuting authorities noted that , in spite of the evidence submitted to the investigation file , the decision of 20 xxmaj september 1995 had not examined the liability of the head of the xxmaj patriotic xxmaj guards , xxmaj colonel xxup p.c. , nor that of the servicemen who had played a role in organising the procedure for executing the orders issued by the xxmaj head of xxmaj state or his xxmaj ministers . \n",
       "  xxmaj the prosecuting authorities noted that evidence had not been taken from certain injured parties during the investigation ; that servicemen belonging to those regiments which had been deployed to quell the demonstrators had not been questioned ; that the registers kept by the military units involved in the repression had not been requested and thus not checked ; and that the investigation had not considered the possible involvement of other public institutions , such as , for example , the use of vehicles belonging to the xxmaj post xxmaj office for transporting prisoners . \n",
       "  33.by a decision of the same day , namely 7 xxmaj december 2004 , the military prosecutor ’s office ordered the indictment of 102 persons , essentially officers , including high - ranking officers , from the xxmaj army , police and xxmaj securitate forces , for murder ( xxmaj articles 174 - 176 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , genocide ( xxmaj article357 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , inhuman treatment ( xxmaj article 358 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ) , attempts to commit those acts , complicity and instigation in the commission of the above acts and participation lato sensu ( participaţie improprie ) in them , acts committed “ during the period from 21to 30 xxmaj december 1989 ” . xxmaj sixteen civilians , including a former xxmaj president of xxmaj romania and a former xxmaj head of the xxmaj romanian xxmaj intelligence xxmaj service , were also charged . \n",

       "  35.by a decision of 9 xxmaj january 2006 , the military prosecution authorities ordered that the file concerning the investigation into the fatal repression in xxmaj braşov , in the course of which the son of the applicants xxmaj mr and xxmaj mrs xxmaj vlase had been killed , be joined to case no . 97 / p / 1990 . xxmaj that decision was justified by the fact that the military commanders who had acted in xxmaj braşov from 16 to 30 xxmaj december 1989 were subordinate to xxmaj general xxup g.v. , head of the xxmaj first xxmaj army . \n",
       "  xxup 36.a letter of 22 xxmaj may 2009 from the military prosecuting authorities indicates that 126 decisions to discontinue proceedings , issued in the separate investigations , were set aside and the relevant files attached to case no . 97 / p / 1990 . \n",

       "  xxmaj the above - cited letter mentioned another reason for the delay , namely decision no . 610 / 2007 of the xxmaj constitutional xxmaj court of 16 xxmaj july 2007 , which withdrew jurisdiction to conduct investigations in case no.97 / p / 1990 from the military prosecuting authorities at the xxmaj high xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and xxmaj justice and transferred it to the civil prosecutors , that is , to the prosecutor ’s office at the xxmaj high xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation and xxmaj justice . xxmaj in the opinion of the head of the military prosecutor ’s office , as stated in the above - cited letter of 5june 2008 , the transfer of the case was sufficient to entail new delays in the proceedings , given the significant volume of the case file , the complexity of the case and the time that had elapsed since the events under investigation . \n",
       "  39.according to data submitted by the xxmaj government , following resumption of the investigation , evidence was taken from 2,800 witnesses and 320 injured parties in 2007 , while only 72 witnesses and 38 injured parties had been questioned in 2005 . xxmaj evidence was taken from xxunk and 210 injured parties in 2008 . 443 photographic xxunk and plates were examined in 2006 ; 175 were examined in 2007 . \n",

       "  xxup 44.a report drawn up on 3 xxmaj january 1990 following an external forensic examination , without an autopsy , at the xxmaj braşov forensic medical laboratory indicated that death had resulted from an injury inflicted by a firearm , which had caused an external haemorrhage . xxmaj according to a statement of 27november2008 by officer xxup c. , a medical doctor at the xxmaj braşov military hospital at the material time , he had received an order not to conduct autopsies on corpses . \n",
       "  45.on 26 xxmaj february 1990 the same doctor xxup c. from the military hospital submitted a “ report ” to the head of the xxmaj braşov county police , following a request from xxunk ] . xxmaj in this report , he stated that “ xxunk , between 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. , the body of xxmaj vlase xxmaj nicolae , aged 19 years , from xxmaj braşov , killed in the xxmaj revolution , in the area of the county council building , was brought in ” and that “ on xxunk , he was transported to the morgue for a post - mortem examination ” . \n",

       "  xxunk , in the years 1991 - 2008 , the applicants submitted numerous pleadings to the prosecuting authorities at the xxmaj supreme xxmaj court of xxmaj justice and to the xxmaj minister of xxmaj justice and the xxmaj president of the xxmaj republic . xxmaj they asked that those who had tortured and killed their son be identified and held liable . xxmaj in 1999 they received , for the first time , information about the investigation . xxmaj according the third applicant ( xxmaj mrs xxmaj vlase ) , prior to that date the four prosecutors responsible for the investigation had merely recommended to her verbally that she be hospitalised for care and criticised her for failing to keep her son at home , and thus avoid him being killed . \n",

       "  xxmaj the decision indicated that it had not been possible to establish the exact location in the city centre where each of those persons had fallen , since the corpses had been removed before the gunfire had ended , in each case during the night , and they had been identified at a subsequent stage in the military hospital morgue , the county hospital or the forensic medical laboratory to which they had been taken . \n",
       "  xxmaj having noted that several hundred armed servicemen had intervened in order to protect the city ’s most important institutions from an imminent attack , but without identifying those buildings , the military prosecuting authorities stated that “ the gunfire had been started in error , without an order to that effect , in the specific conditions of the moment , namely stress , fear of alleged terrorists and fatigue on the part of the military officers ” . xxmaj the civilians found themselves caught in the crossfire between servicemen occupying opposing positions . xxmaj the large number of victims on the night of 22 to 23december1989 in xxmaj braşov city centre was also explained by the fact that the servicemen from the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj national xxmaj defence had used more than 270,000 cartridges , the xxmaj securitate militia had used xxunk and the xxmaj patriotic guards and those civilians who had obtained rifles had used xxunk . xxmaj machine guns had also been used and more than a hundred grenades had been thrown . \n",
       "  xxmaj the military prosecuting authorities considered that the lack of judgment shown by the commanders of the xxmaj braşov garrison in failing to take account of the state of mind of the military personnel placed under their command , their tiredness and the stress they were under , could not engage their criminal liability . xxmaj in their defence , the military prosecuting authorities noted the military officers’ lack of experience in urban combat and noted that they had not taken measures prior to the opening of fire in order to establish means of communication between the units deployed in the area . \n",
       "  49.the relevant parts of the decision read as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj when the gunfire began in the city centre , several hundred persons were present , including women and young people , who were responding to an appeal on the national television channel inviting them to take to the streets because the revolution was in danger . \n",

       "  xxmaj in those circumstances , dozens of people , including servicemen , were hit by bullets in the first minutes after the gunfire began . \n",
       "  xxmaj all of the servicemen who were in xxmaj braşov city centre that night , the vast majority of whom gave evidence , stated that they were tired , as the majority had been posted there since the previous night , namely 21 to 22 xxmaj december 1989 , that they were all afraid , because they had learned what was happening in xxmaj bucharest and that , on their own initiative , they had loaded their weapons , since they were expecting to be attacked from one moment to the next . \n",
       "  xxmaj in those circumstances , it had been sufficient that civilian xxup i.e. fire the first shots in the direction of persons whom he considered suspect for all of the servicemen in the city centre to open fire in turn , without prior orders from their commanders ... \n",
       "  xxmaj all of the armed individuals – both servicemen and civilians – who used their weapons in the city centre during the night of 22 to 23 xxmaj december 1989 were acting in good faith and were attached to the revolution , and were convinced that they were acting to protect it . xxmaj they used their weapons on account of the prevailing confusion and the considerable fear and suspicion which had taken hold of everyone who was in the streets . ” \n",

       "  xxmaj in addition , as regards the formal propriety of the document of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , once a child is entrusted to the social services , the latter assume a number of obligations , including the provision of information ... xxmaj it appears from the record of the child ’s placement , which contains entries whose existence is not disputed , that the social services fulfilled their obligation to provide information on a child ’s placement in xxmaj state care and the ensuing legal effects . xxmaj such information was , moreover , provided in xxmaj english , and the notice and model letter requesting the return of the child were indeed given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk fully understood the meaning and scope of this information since she left documents for the child in the event that the latter expressed the wish to discover her origins at a future date . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk clearly expressed her wish that the child should never be able to have legal ties to her . xxmaj moreover , she did not withdraw her consent within the two - month period . xxmaj it should be noted in this connection that this right is strictly personal ; accordingly , no action by a third person may be treated as an action to withdraw consent , that being the sole prerogative of the mother , or interrupt the relevant period . \n",
       "  xxmaj accordingly , there are no grounds for declaring null and void the record of 19february 2002 , which served as an entirely valid basis for the placement in xxmaj state care ( first provisionally and later with final effect ) of the child born on 18 xxmaj february 2002 with no established parentage ... \n",
       "  xxmaj since the mother did not apply for the return of the child within two months after giving her up , the child , who has no legally established parentage , was able to be placed with foster parents by the xxmaj state authorities with a view to her adoption under xxmaj article 351 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj such placement for adoption , by virtue of the provisions of xxmaj article 352 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code , constitutes a bar not only to the return of the child to the mother but also to any declaration of filiation or recognition . xxmaj the first ground of appeal must therefore be declared ineffective . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk further alleges a violation of xxmaj articles 13 and 14 of the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights . \n",
       "  xxmaj as stated above , xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk gave birth ... while wishing to keep the birth and her identity secret , a right enshrined in xxmaj article 341 - 1 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj code and given effect by the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code . \n",
       "  xxmaj more generally , these xxmaj articles govern the conditions for giving up a child , for consent to adoption or for anonymous registration of a birth , as well as the conditions and procedures applicable in the event of repudiation and / or withdrawal of any of these measures . \n",
       "  xxmaj they strike a delicate balance between the rights of a mother , which the legislature has to date had no intention of reconsidering , to give birth anonymously with the consequences that entails , and the rights of the foster parents and of the child , whose rights are now framed in such a way as to allow him or her access to more information , if he or she so desires , but in whose interests stability and certainty , both psychological and legal , must be sought , if only through the shortness of the time within which the natural parents may avail themselves of the appropriate procedures . \n",
       "  xxmaj the instant case thus can not be said to involve any discrimination or deprivation of the enjoyment of a right secured to the mother or the child by the xxmaj european xxmaj convention on xxmaj human xxmaj rights , or indeed our national law , within the meaning of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj convention . xxmaj similarly , no matter how short they are , time - limits do exist in xxmaj french law for bringing an action in the ordinary courts , constituting , within the meaning of xxmaj article 13 of the xxmaj convention ... , an effective remedy before a national authority independent of the administrative authority that may be required to rule on an application for the return of a child or to approve an adoption . ” \n",
       "  22.the applicant appealed . xxmaj in a judgment of 22 xxmaj september 2003 the xxmaj douai xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal set aside the first - instance judgment . xxmaj after reiterating the content of the record of 19 xxmaj february 2002 , and in particular the information it provided , the court held : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj paragraph 3 of the section on information thus expressly mentions the existence of two time - limits for the child ’s return without any further formalities , one being two months ( the only possible limit that could apply in the instant case ) , the other being six months , where the second parent has not entrusted the child to the social services . \n",
       "  xxmaj this six - month time - limit is mentioned on two further occasions , firstly in relation to the right to have the child returned to the second parent and secondly in indicating that even after the expiry of the two - month and six - month periods , a court action may still be brought . \n",
       "  xxmaj this information could have misled xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... since in reality the six - month time - limit applicable under xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 6 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code in the circumstances referred to in xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 did not apply in the instant case , there being no established paternity as the mother had registered the birth anonymously , and the placement therefore came under point ( 1 ) of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 . \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk , an xxmaj irish national who is a native xxmaj english speaker and does not speak xxmaj french , could not have known the consequences in xxmaj french law of anonymous registration of the birth , in terms of her rights and those of the biological father , and the information given was in no way capable of xxunk her in a clear and precise manner . \n",
       "  xxmaj having been informed of the existence of a six - month time - limit where ‘ the child has a second parent who did not entrust him or her to the service’ , she may legitimately have thought , in the light of the information set out in the record , that this time - limit was applicable in her case since she had on several occasions notified the local health and social services department of the existence of a biological father who had not been informed of the placement procedure . \n",
       "  xxmaj it will be observed that there is no mention in the record that an interpreter was present when it was signed and that it has not been disputed that a member of the maternity ward staff assisted with the translation and the explanation in xxmaj english of the information given in xxmaj french to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... xxmaj however , a translation of this nature , which was provided by a person who used xxmaj english only occasionally and did not have specific legal knowledge , and which , moreover , was based on particularly ambiguous information as to the time - limits , did not enable xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... to have access to proper information about her rights regarding the procedures for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj it therefore appears that the information provided to the appellant concerning the right to have the child returned was inaccurate or at least particularly ambiguous , and was set out in a pre - printed document not specially adapted to the procedure of anonymous birth registration but designed for use in any of the circumstances covered by xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 4 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code for the taking of a child into xxmaj state care ; that reference was made to a six - month time - limit not applicable in her case ; and that , moreover , being an native xxmaj english speaker , the mother was not effectively informed of the procedures for the return of her child and of the strict two - month time - limit that applied in her case . \n",
       "  xxmaj furthermore , it has not been shown in any way that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... otherwise received any clear information before the record was signed as to her right to recover the child . \n",
       "  xxmaj the note by xxmaj ms xxup f. – who also drew up the record in issue – besides having no evidential value , since it was written by a party to the proceedings , does not contain any clarification as to the information given to xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... about the time - limit for withdrawing consent . \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , the fact that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... was in contact with a xxmaj french lawyer prior to the birth does not mean that she received precise information from him about the exclusive nature of the two - month time - limit ... \n",
       "  xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk belief ... in the possibility of recovering the child within a six - month period is corroborated by the request she made in person on 25 and 26 xxmaj july 2002 to the xxmaj nord health and social services department , citing this time - limit , and by the subsequent letters from her lawyer , which also state that his client thought that she could take her child back within such a period . \n",
       "  xxmaj having regard to all these considerations , it appears that xxmaj ms xxmaj xxunk ... placed her child in xxmaj state care while believing – legitimately , in view of the ambiguous information she had received when signing the record of the placement – that she could take her back within a period of six months and that this time - limit also applied to xxmaj mr xxup b. , who had , moreover , instituted proceedings in xxmaj ireland on 9april 2002 . \n",
       "  xxmaj this error as to the time - limit for the return of the child concerns a significant element of her consent to the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care , especially as the provisions of xxmaj article xxup l. 224 - 5 of the xxmaj social xxmaj action and xxmaj families xxmaj code require precise information on the subject to be given to the mother . \n",

       "  ... seeing that the handing over of the child to the xxmaj state authorities was rendered void by a lack of true consent affecting the validity of the record drawn up on 19february 2002 , the child ’s placement in xxmaj state care is to be retrospectively annulled and can not therefore have any legal effect . \n",

       "  xxunk countries simply make the validity of consent subject to “ the recovery of the mother after giving birth ” or to the condition that it is given after the birth . xxmaj lastly , the legislation in other countries makes no provision for a period of reflection , but “ prenatal ” consent remains prohibited by law in the vast majority of legal systems . \n",

       "  xxunk countries have instituted a period within which the biological parents may revoke their consent . xxmaj there is considerable diversity in the legislation of the member xxmaj states that have provided for this possibility ; some systems allow consent to be withdrawn until the adoption order is issued and others until the adoption process has been initiated , whereas others lay down fixed periods whose length varies from country to country . xxmaj lastly , in some countries the biological parents’ consent is irrevocable . \n",
       "  44.the effects of withdrawal of consent likewise vary from one xxmaj state to another . xxmaj in countries such as xxmaj france or xxmaj switzerland , where consent may be revoked during a specified period , the withdrawal has an absolute effect in that it puts an end to the adoption process and opens up the possibility of the child ’s return . xxmaj conversely , in systems where consent may be withdrawn until the adoption order is issued , the withdrawal does not automatically end the process and the courts are required to make a decision on the child ’s return on the basis of the child ’s best interests . \n",

       "  8.the applicant was convicted on 21 xxmaj february 2007 , at the age of twenty , of two counts of possession of xxmaj class a drugs with intent to supply . xxmaj he pleaded guilty on the basis that he had been coerced into letting his premises be used for the preparation and sale of drugs by a group of people whom he feared because of a previous attack in 2005 , in which the applicant had been shot . xxmaj he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment , and on 18october 2007 was notified of the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state ’s intention to deport him . xxmaj the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state found that there was no evidence that the applicant had been present in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom since the age of three . xxmaj his aunt had stated that he had been left with her by his mother at the age of five , and the first official record of his presence was when he was eight years old . xxmaj even allowing for his long stay in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , only four years had been with valid leave . xxmaj it was believed that he was in contact with his mother , who remained in xxmaj nigeria , and that as he had lived alone since attaining the age of majority , the applicant was evidently independent and capable of adapting to new circumstances . xxmaj it was not accepted that he had family life in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . \n",
       "  9.the applicant appealed against the decision to deport him and his appeal was dismissed by the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal on 13march 2008 . xxmaj the xxmaj tribunal noted the applicant ’s previous criminal record : he had been convicted of possession of xxmaj class a and xxmaj class b drugs in xxmaj february 2004 ; handling stolen goods in xxmaj april 2004 ; and possession of xxmaj class c drugs in xxmaj june 2005 . \n",

       "  21.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal went on to expand upon the nature of the test . xxmaj it required firstly , that the treatment that the person was at risk of suffering should reach a minimum level of severity . xxmaj secondly , there must be a causal link between the act or threatened act of removal or expulsion and the treatment relied upon as breaching xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj the court also found , thirdly , that because of the “ foreign ” nature of expulsion cases , the threshold for what would meet the threshold of xxmaj article 3 would be particularly high and higher still when the treatment did not result from the direct or indirect actions of the authorities of the receiving xxmaj state but from a naturally occurring physical or mental illness . xxmaj fourthly , a risk of suicide could , in principle , form the basis of a successful claim under xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj fifthly , an important factor in determining whether removal would breach xxmaj article 3 in the case of an applicant who claimed to be suicidal was whether his or her alleged fear of ill - treatment in the receiving xxmaj state , if such a fear was at the root of the risk of suicide , was objectively well - founded . a fear found not to be objectively well - founded would weigh against a finding of a real risk of a violation of xxmaj article 3 . xxmaj finally , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal also considered it to be of considerable relevance whether the removing and / or receiving xxmaj states had effective mechanisms in place to reduce the risk of suicide . xxmaj the existence of such mechanisms would also weigh heavily against a finding of a violation of xxmaj article 3 as a result of removal . \n",
       "  22.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal further held that the correct approach to an alleged risk of suicide in an expulsion case was to consider the risk in three stages , namely , in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom , in transit , and in the receiving xxmaj state . xxmaj the threshold for xxmaj article 3 in respect of the risk in the receiving xxmaj state was higher than it was in respect of the risk in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom . xxmaj in the case of the particular appellant , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal found that the xxmaj asylum and xxmaj immigration xxmaj tribunal had been correct to find that the risk of suicide in the xxmaj united xxmaj kingdom would be adequately managed by the relevant authorities ; that the xxmaj secretary of xxmaj state would provide appropriately qualified xxunk and as such mitigate the risk of suicide whilst in transport ; and that in light of the finding that the applicant ’s fears of return to xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka were not objectively well - founded , and that he would have family support and access to adequate medical treatment in that xxmaj state , the risk of suicide in xxmaj sri xxmaj lanka would not reach the very high threshold of xxmaj article 3 . \n",

       "  12.on 27 xxmaj december 1991 the xxmaj director of the xxmaj warsaw xxmaj district xxmaj office refused to return the plots to the applicants and to grant them the right to their perpetual use . xxmaj he stated that it had been established during the proceedings that in 1947 the applicants’ predecessor in title had submitted an application for temporary ownership of the plots , which had then been listed in the xxmaj warsaw xxmaj land xxmaj register under entries nos . 415 and xxunk . xxmaj this application had remained unanswered , but the administrative authority had duly examined it in the course of the current proceedings . xxmaj it was established that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at 70 to 75 % during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war , as was pointed out in a letter of the xxmaj regional xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj historical xxmaj monuments of 28 xxmaj november 1991 . xxmaj the palace had subsequently been rebuilt by the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture . xxmaj thus it had been the xxmaj state xxmaj treasury which had borne the costs of rebuilding the palace . xxmaj accordingly , restitution of the property concerned would have been unjustified , and the administrative authority found no grounds on which the 1947 application and the request lodged by the applicants in 1990 should be granted . \n",
       "  13.the applicants lodged an appeal against that decision . xxmaj they argued that the decision was not in conformity with the applicable laws , in particular as the first - instance authority had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the palace had indeed been destroyed during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war . xxmaj they also complained that no sound arguments had been advanced in the decision to show that restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its public use . \n",
       "  14.on 27 xxmaj february 1992 the xxmaj governor ’s xxmaj office rejected the applicants’ appeal , finding that it had been lodged one day after the expiration of the fourteen - day time - limit provided for in the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure . \n",
       "  15.the applicants filed an appeal with the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court . xxmaj they argued that the appeal had been posted on 20 xxmaj january 1992 , that is on the last day of the time - limit , as was shown by a post - office receipt . xxmaj the fact that the postmark on the envelope was dated 21 xxmaj january 1992 was due exclusively to the incomprehensible negligence of the postal services and could not be held against the applicants . \n",
       "  16.on 24 xxmaj july 1992 the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court quashed the decision appealed against , considering that it was not established that the applicants had lodged their appeal against the decision of 27 xxmaj december 1991 outside the time - limit provided for by the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure , in particular because the applicants had submitted the post - office receipt to the court , showing clearly that their appeal had been posted on 20january 1992 . \n",
       "  17.on 9 xxmaj september 1993 the xxmaj office of the xxmaj governor of xxmaj warsaw , having examined the applicants’ appeal of 20 xxmaj january 1992 , upheld the decision of 27december 1991 . xxmaj it pointed out that the administrative authority had established that the property of the applicants’ predecessor - in - title had been designated by relevant land - development plans adopted in 1947 , 1983 and 1992 for use by the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture and xxmaj arts . xxmaj that designation had not been changed by any subsequent decision , as was certified by a letter of 19august 1993 from the xxmaj director of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration xxmaj department of the xxmaj warsaw xxmaj district xxmaj office . xxmaj the xxmaj governor further held that the palace built on the plots had been destroyed at 70 to 75 % during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war , as was certified by a letter of the xxmaj regional xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj historical xxmaj monuments of 28 xxmaj november 1991 . xxmaj the palace had been rebuilt in the late 1940s by the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture and xxmaj arts . xxmaj as it had been the xxmaj state xxmaj treasury that had borne the rebuilding costs , it had acquired ownership of the property concerned . xxmaj moreover , at the time when xxmaj roman xxmaj potocki had lodged the application for temporary ownership , the buildings on the plot had not existed , as they had been destroyed . xxmaj the administrative authority concluded that , in the light of the above considerations , granting the applicants the right to perpetual use would be unjustified . \n",
       "  18.on 12 xxmaj october 1993 the applicants lodged an appeal with the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court against that judgment , complaining that the impugned decision was not in conformity with applicable substantive law . xxmaj they first submitted that the decision was in breach of xxmaj article 7 of the 1945 decree in that the administrative authorities had failed to establish with sufficient clarity that the applicants’ intentions as to the future use of the palace had not been compatible with the local land - development plan . xxmaj the applicants emphasised that the authorities had disregarded their argument that they did not plan to alter the public nature of the palace . xxmaj they had only wanted to reserve a small part of it for their exclusive use , whereas the remainder would be used for cultural and leisure purposes and would be accessible to the general public . xxmaj therefore , no issue arose , in fact , regarding the designation of the property for public use as its use was to remain unchanged . xxmaj moreover , the authorities had failed to indicate why the restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with its continued public use . \n",
       "  19.the applicants further stressed that the authorities had failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the buildings on the plots had been destroyed during the xxmaj second xxmaj world xxmaj war and subsequently rebuilt by the xxmaj state , and that they should therefore be considered the xxmaj state ’s property . xxmaj the findings made in this respect were superficial and based on insufficient evidence . xxmaj the applicants emphasised in particular that the letter from the xxmaj regional xxmaj xxunk of xxmaj historical xxmaj monuments of 28 xxmaj november 1991 could not reasonably be regarded as credible , as the xxunk operated under the supervision of the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj culture and thus could not be expected to act against the ministry ’s interests . xxmaj in view of that flaw , the authorities should have requested a report by an expert on construction technology in order to verify the information in the xxunk ’s letter . xxmaj in conclusion , the applicants requested that the decision under appeal should be set aside and that the case should be re - examined . \n",
       "  20.the applicants submitted that xxmaj articles 7 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 35 1 and 3 , 75 1 , 77 1 , 78 1 and 107 3 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure had been breached in the course of the proceedings and that those procedural shortcomings had had a bearing on the outcome of the case . \n",
       "  21.on an unspecified date a hearing was held before the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court in the appeal proceedings . xxmaj the applicants’ lawyer submitted that their application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 was to be seen both as a reiterated application for temporary ownership , lodged in 1947 , and as a new application for restitution of the property concerned and for having a right to perpetual use of the land awarded . \n",
       "  22.by a judgment of 22 xxmaj june 1995 the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court rejected the applicants’ appeal in so far as it concerned the application for temporary ownership , which had been submitted by xxmaj roman xxmaj potocki in 1947 . xxmaj in doing so , the court recalled that , pursuant to xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court xxmaj act of 31 xxmaj january 1980 , as amended , it was not competent to deal with appeals against administrative decisions given in cases in which proceedings had been instituted before 1 xxmaj september 1980 . xxmaj accordingly , the court could not review the lawfulness of that part of the contested second - instance administrative decision , given that the relevant proceedings had been instituted in 1947 . \n",
       "  23.in so far as the decision under appeal concerned the applicants’ application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 for restitution of their former property and for the right to perpetual use of the land under the provisions of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act of 1985 , the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court first considered that the authorities had failed to show why restitution of the property to the applicants would be incompatible with public use of the plot and the palace , and had therefore breached xxmaj article 107 3 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj administrative xxmaj procedure , under which an administrative authority , when issuing a decision , was required to point out the facts on which it had relied , to refer to evidence which had served as a basis for its factual findings , and to indicate the grounds on which other evidence had not been considered credible . \n",
       "  xxmaj the court further considered that despite those procedural shortcomings the decision under appeal had , in any event , been lawful . xxmaj the court noted that the crux of that part of the case was to assess whether the applicants could , under the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act of 1985 , claim to have a right to perpetual use of the plots concerned conferred on them by way of compensation for the expropriation carried out under the 1945 decree . \n",
       "  xxmaj the court observed that under section xxunk ) of the xxmaj land xxmaj administration and xxmaj expropriation xxmaj act , a right to perpetual use of land could only be conferred in cases where real property was given back to its former owners . xxmaj however , that entitlement had been limited to certain categories of real property , namely one - family houses or small apartment blocks . xxmaj the property concerned in the present case did not belong to any of those categories . xxmaj moreover , the 1985 xxmaj act had laid down a time - limit for the submission of such claims , and that limit had expired on 31 xxmaj december 1988 . xxmaj the applicants’ application of 20 xxmaj december 1990 to have their former property restored to them and for the right to perpetual use of the property had been lodged outside that time - limit . xxmaj accordingly , the restitution could not have been ordered . xxmaj the xxmaj supreme xxmaj administrative xxmaj court therefore dismissed the remainder of the applicants’ appeal . \n",
