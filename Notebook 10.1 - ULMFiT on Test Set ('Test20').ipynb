       "  1.the case originated in an application ( no . xxunk / 03 ) against the xxmaj republic of xxmaj bulgaria lodged with the xxmaj court under xxmaj article 34 of the xxmaj convention for the xxmaj protection of xxmaj human xxmaj rights and xxmaj fundamental xxmaj freedoms ( “ the xxmaj convention ” ) by a xxmaj bulgarian national , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj pankov ( “ the applicant ” ) , on 28 xxmaj march 2003 . \n",
       "  2.the applicant was represented by xxmaj mr xxup y. xxmaj grozev , a lawyer practising in xxmaj sofia and by xxmaj mr xxup b. xxmaj boev , formerly a lawyer practising in xxmaj sofia , who on 7october 2008 was granted leave under xxmaj rule 36 4 ( a ) in fine of the xxmaj rules of xxmaj court to continue representing the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj bulgarian xxmaj government ( “ the xxmaj government ” ) were represented by their xxmaj agents , xxmaj ms xxup n. xxmaj nikolova and xxmaj ms xxup s. xxmaj atanasova , of the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj justice . \n",
       "  3.the applicant alleged that his lifethreatening injury sustained during military shooting practice was due to the use of deadly force by another serviceman , that the authorities failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent that from happening , and that the ensuing investigation was not effective . \n",
       "  4.on 4 xxmaj december 2008 the xxmaj president of the xxmaj fifth xxmaj section decided to give notice of the application to the xxmaj government . xxmaj it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility ( xxmaj article 29 3 of the xxmaj convention ) . \n",

       "  xxup i.the xxup circumstances xxup of xxup the xxup case \n",
       "  5.the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in xxmaj pleven . \n",
       "  a.the incident of 22 xxmaj july 1999 \n",
       "  6.in xxmaj april 1999 the applicant was conscripted into the xxmaj bulgarian xxmaj army to perform his mandatory military service . xxmaj he was serving in a regiment in the town of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj banya . xxmaj in mid - xxmaj july 1999 the regiment doctor relieved him from physical exercise and daily duty because of illness . xxmaj nevertheless , on the night of 21 xxmaj july 1999 he was assigned to night duty . \n",
       "  7.after finishing his duty , in the morning of 22 xxmaj july 1999 the applicant was sent , together with other soldiers from his regiment , to shooting practice at a military shooting range near the town of xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj during the practice soldiers from the applicant 's regiment and another regiment were present on the range . xxmaj the applicant performed his task , which consisted of firing twelve rounds . xxmaj after that he handed back all spent cartridge cases and was sent to a watchtower to guard against outsiders penetrating into the range . xxmaj the tower was a square concrete construction 9.3 metres long and 7metres wide . xxmaj in the middle it had a xxunk chimney . \n",
       "  8.at about 11.10 a.m. , minutes after climbing up the tower , the applicant was shot in the abdomen . xxmaj according to the findings of the ensuing investigation , the shot was fired at close range from his own automatic rifle , whose breechblock he was trying to fix without following the applicable safety procedures . xxmaj the applicant disputes those findings and asserts that the shot was in all probability fired by another soldier from afar . \n",
       "  9.after the shot the applicant fell down on the roof of the tower , screaming and moaning . xxmaj chief xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. , who was sitting with a few soldiers from his regiment at the foot of the tower , rushed up the stairs . xxmaj he brought the applicant down with the help of soldier xxup t. and medical officer xxup n.g. , who were also at the foot of the tower and climbed up after the shot . \n",
       "  10.after that the applicant was put into an ambulance and transported , accompanied by medical officer xxup n.g. , to the xxmaj military xxmaj medical xxmaj academy in xxmaj sofia , where he underwent lifesaving surgical operations on 23 , 26 and 27july 1999 . xxmaj on 28 xxmaj july 1999 his condition was found to be serious but stable . xxmaj he was discharged from hospital on 9 xxmaj september 1999 , and later received a medical discharge from the army . \n",
       "  b.the investigation \n",
       "  11.on the day of the incident a military investigator , notified by the military police , opened a preliminary investigation whose aim was to “ determine the causes and the circumstances in which [ the applicant ] shot himself ” . \n",
       "  12.at 2.30 p.m. the investigator inspected the scene of the incident . xxmaj he found that it had not been preserved intact . xxmaj he described in detail everything he found . xxmaj he also identified , on the basis of the statement of xxmaj chief xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. , the likely positions of the applicant 's body and of his rifle “ after the shot ” . xxmaj he impounded the rifle , a xxunk and xxunk cartridge case , some pieces of dark reddish matter , dactyloscopic traces from the rifle , and traces from the surface of the tower . \n",
       "  13.later that day the hospital where the applicant had been operated upon sent the investigator the piece of skin surrounding his entry wound and acetone smears from his palms . xxmaj the applicant 's commander handed over to the investigator the shirt he had been wearing during the shooting and some of his personal items . \n",
       "  14.the next day , 23 xxmaj july 1999 , the investigator interviewed xxmaj chief xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. , a sergeant responsible for counting the targets at the shooting range , the applicant 's mother , and xxmaj captain xxup y.p. , the officer in charge of the shooting practice . xxmaj he also ordered a complex ballistic , microbiological and physicochemical report and a medical expert report . \n",
       "  xxunk xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. said that while he was sitting at the foot of the watchtower he heard a single shot from above , much xxunk than those coming from the firing range , and then heard screaming from the top of the tower . xxmaj he climbed up the stairs and saw the applicant lying on the ground , moaning and xxunk his upper body up and down . xxmaj he noticed that the applicant 's shirt was unbuttoned and that he had a wound on the left side of his abdomen . xxmaj the wound did not have a clear shape and looked more like a star than a hole . xxmaj it was surrounded by a round black patch with a diameter of five to seven centimetres and consisting of many black spots close together . xxmaj the lieutenant saw another wound on the applicant 's back , with a clear round shape , one centimetre in diameter , with a little blood on it . xxmaj he also saw the applicant 's rifle , which did not have a round in its chamber , had its safety lever down and was in xxunk mode . \n",
       "  16.captain xxup y.p. handed over to the investigator the order and the plan for the shooting practice , and described the safety briefing given to all soldiers before the start of the shooting practice . xxmaj he said that after the briefing a chief lieutenant checked the weapons of all soldiers taking part in the practice , and ordered two soldiers to step aside and clean their weapons . xxmaj then the captain announced to the soldiers the manner in which the practice would be conducted and the safety measures . xxmaj they were to fire solely upon his command , and stop firing immediately if he so ordered , or if they received a visual signal from the watchtower , or if they noticed people , animals or machines near the targets . xxmaj the firing range was delimited by xxunk at both ends . xxmaj it was strictly forbidden , under any circumstances , to point a firearm outside the firing range . xxmaj if a firearm jammed , the soldier had to report it immediately , remain still , put the safety catch down and not touch the firearm . xxmaj the soldiers fired in groups of four , with those waiting their turn having unloaded weapons . xxmaj the soldiers first went to the starting point , received magazines containing twelve rounds , and put them in their bags , while keeping their rifles on their backs . xxmaj when they received the order to fire , they had to run to the firing position with their rifles pointing towards the firing range . xxmaj then , on a further order , they had to take the magazines out of the bags , put them onto the rifles , load a round , lift the safety catch and report that they were ready to fire . xxmaj when ordered to fire , after the captain had made sure that each of them had loaded his weapon and was ready to fire , they put the safety catch in automatic firing mode and started firing . xxmaj after finishing firing , they had to report , remove the magazine , and , when ordered , fire a control shot towards the firing range and put the safety catch on . xxmaj after that they had to stand up , have their rifles checked by the captain with the magazine removed , fire a second control shot , and hand back the spent cartridges . xxmaj at the time of the incident a group of soldiers was firing , with the captain standing about two metres behind them . xxmaj immediately after hearing the applicant 's screams the captain ordered the soldiers to stop firing and empty their weapons , and then checked the weapons . \n",
       "  17.the order for the shooting practice , issued by the head of the regiment , designed a commanding officer , an officer , a sergeant and a soldier ensuring the sealing off of the area , a technician , an emergency medical officer , a standby ambulance , two guards , one of whom was the applicant , and a head of the ammunition supply point . xxmaj it directed the commanding officer to ensure compliance with the safety measures in line with the applicable instructions . xxmaj an annex to that order shows that all the soldiers confirmed that they had been briefed about the safety measures . \n",
       "  18.on 27 xxmaj july 1999 the investigator interviewed medical officer xxup n.g. , sergeantmajor xxup g.i. , the person in charge of ammunition safety during the shooting practice , and soldier xxup r.v. of the applicant 's regiment . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk said that , while sitting at the foot of the watchtower , she heard a loud whizzing sound and then screaming . xxmaj she climbed up the tower and saw a wound on the applicant 's abdomen . xxmaj it was a small hole with a round xxunk patch around it . xxmaj later , the officer was with the applicant in the ambulance , she noticed another wound , with a diameter of one centimetre , on the left side of his lower back . xxmaj in the ambulance , she repeatedly asked the applicant how he had sustained the injury , but he kept silent . xxmaj at one point , he said “ i wanted to fix it ” . xxmaj she pressed him for more , but he said “ xxmaj oh , leave me , leave me ” and asked whether they had already reached the hospital . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk said that following the incident , when he had been counting the cartridge cases spent during the shooting practice , somebody , probably xxmaj lieutenant xxup m. , threw a cartridge case on to the pile , and it got mixed up with the others . xxmaj when xxup g.i. enquired about the case 's origin , lieutenant xxup m. had replied that it had come from the scene of the incident . xxmaj later , with a view to identifying the case , the officer in charge of the practice ordered xxup g.i. to divide the cases up into lots . xxmaj he found only one with a diverging serial number , and handed it over to the investigator . xxup g.i. also said that he was certain that the applicant had earlier returned to him all twelve cases of the cartridges allotted to him for the shooting practice . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk said that the applicant had been in a good mood on the day of the incident , that both of them had had their rifles checked and returned their spent cartridge cases after the shooting practice , and that , prior to climbing up the watchtower , the applicant did not have a magazine on his rifle . \n",
       "  22.on 29 xxmaj july 1999 the investigator interviewed the applicant , who was still in the intensive care unit of the emergency surgical department of the xxmaj military xxmaj medical xxmaj academy in xxmaj sofia ( see paragraph 10 above ) . xxmaj according to the record of this interview , the applicant said that while he was on the watchtower he tried to fix his rifle 's sling . xxmaj he knelt down on his right knee and laid the rifle on the ground with the muzzle pointing towards him . xxmaj he noticed that the safety catch was in automatic firing position and the breechblock was not in position . xxmaj with his right hand he pushed the breechblock forward . xxmaj it jammed and he used force to push it , with the rifle 's barrel lying on his left hand and the magazine holder pointing upwards . xxmaj when the breechblock moved into position , he heard a shot . xxmaj he became short of breath and started crying for help . \n",
       "  23.the applicant strongly disputes the accuracy of this record and maintains that , being in a very serious medical condition , he could not remember how this interview unfolded or the statements he made during it . xxmaj he submits that the only reliable statements were those which he made during a subsequent interview on 13 xxmaj september 1999 , four days after his discharge from hospital . xxmaj at that interview he said that before going to the tower he fired all twelve cartridges at the shooting range and then returned the spent cases to sergeantmajor xxup g.i. xxmaj when going up the tower , he noticed two sergeants there , talked to them for a while and then remained alone . xxmaj when standing with his left side toward the shooting range and his rifle slung over his shoulder , he suddenly felt powerless , weak in the knees and short of breath , but did not hear a shot close by . xxmaj he started shouting for help and ten seconds later someone came up to him . \n",
       "  24.on 11 and 17 xxmaj november 1999 the investigator interviewed xxmaj captain xxup v.p. , a staff doctor from the applicant 's regiment , and two soldiers serving with the applicant . xxmaj all of them said that they had not seen any signs of depression in the applicant prior to the incident . \n",
       "  25.the medical expert report ordered by the investigator was drawn up on 28 xxmaj july 1999 by xxmaj dr xxup g.d. , deputy chief of the xxmaj forensic xxmaj medicine xxmaj centre of the xxmaj bulgarian xxmaj army . xxmaj he had not examined the applicant but based his report on the existing medical documentation . xxmaj the report read as follows : \n",
       "  “ ... xxmaj the entry wound is situated on the front left side of the abdomen , slightly above the navel and on the midclavicular line , with burns on the surrounding skin . xxmaj the exit wound is on the left side of the back , under the corner of the scapula . \n",
       "  xxmaj if the body was in an upright position the channel of the wound would go slightly upward from the front to the back . \n",
       "  xxmaj the entry wound 's description in the medical documents shows that it was the result of a shot from a very close range . xxmaj to determine precisely the distance of the shot it is necessary to carry out a ballistic testing of the clothes worn by [ the applicant ] at the time when the shot was fired . \n",
       "  xxmaj when passing through the body the projectile ( the bullet ) , in addition to damaging the soft tissues , broke the twelfth rib on the left , ruptured the front and the back walls of the stomach , the xxunk colon , the splenic flexure ( in two places ) , and the spleen . xxmaj as a result , there was a flow of faeces and a massive haemorrhage in the abdominal cavity , causing a temporarily lifethreatening medical condition . \n",
       "  xxmaj the above necessitated an emergency lifesaving surgery , consisting of a full midline laparotomy , with a drainage of the blood and the faeces from the abdominal cavity and a resection of the xxunk , a xxunk - shaped resection and stitching of the stomach , partial resection of the transversal colon and of the splenic flexure , with a removal of a xxunk xxunk , surgical removal of the spleen , treatment of the fractured rib , lavage and drainage of the abdominal cavity , and laparostoma . \n",
       "  xxmaj after that surgical intervention the bleeding was stopped and the risk to [ the applicant 's ] life was averted , i.e. the case concerns loss of the spleen . \n",
       "  xxmaj it should be borne in mind that without a timely and xxunk medical intervention death would have occurred very rapidly . \n",
       "  xxmaj after the surgical intervention [ the applicant ] was placed in an intensive care unit . xxmaj following xxmaj xray data about a haemorrhage in the left pleural cavity on 23 xxmaj july 1999 , a left - side xxunk ( drainage of the pleural fluid ) was carried out . xxmaj on 26 xxmaj july 1999 a surgical bandage was made , and on 27 xxmaj july 1999 – a second laparotomy with a revision of the laparostoma and of the abdominal cavity was carried out , a local aesthetic was applied on the mesentery , xxunk and xxunk of the small intestine through it were performed , and a new laparostoma was placed . xxmaj after the surgical intervention the [ applicant ] was again placed in an intensive care unit . xxmaj on 28july 1999 his condition was assessed as being stable but serious . ” \n",
       "  26.on 10 xxmaj september 1999 a biology expert drew up a report saying that the blood - red dry matter taken from the scene of the incident was indeed human blood . xxmaj however , as a result of the depletion of the sample , it was impossible to determine its type or to tell whether it was identical with the applicant 's blood . xxmaj the applicant 's shirt had blood on it . \n",
       "  27.in a report of 14 xxmaj september 1999 three experts stated that the applicant 's rifle was in good working order and able to produce a shot . xxmaj the force needed to be applied to the trigger in order to fire was within the acceptable limits . xxmaj they further found that the rifle had been fired since it had last been cleaned , and that the cartridge case handed over by sergeantmajor xxup g.i. to the investigator did not come from that rifle . \n",
       "  28.in a physicochemical report of 4 xxmaj october 1999 two experts said that they had been unable to conclude whether the gunpowder from the rifle 's barrel was identical to that taken from the applicant 's shirt . xxmaj they also said that the smears from the applicant 's palms and wrist - bands did not contain traces of a shot . \n",
       "  c.the discontinuance of the investigation and the applicant 's appeals \n",
       "  29.on 22 xxmaj november 1999 the investigator proposed discontinuing the investigation . xxmaj he found that the applicant had shot himself at close range . xxmaj there was no evidence pointing to breaches of the regulations on conducting shooting exercises or the applicable safety rules . xxmaj nor was there any indication that the applicant had had psychological problems or depression which could push him to commit suicide , or that he had tried to damage his health with a view to evading military service . xxmaj the evidence thus led to the conclusion that his injury was the result of an accidental shot fired because of his improper handling of his firearm . \n",
       "  30.on 30 xxmaj november 1999 the xxmaj sofia xxmaj military xxmaj regional xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office decided to discontinue the investigation , repeating the reasons given by the investigator verbatim . \n",
       "  31.on 9 xxmaj april 2001 the applicant appealed to the xxmaj military xxmaj appellate xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office . xxmaj he argued , among other things , that the authorities had explored solely the version that he had shot himself . xxmaj no expert report had been drawn up on the identity of the firearm which had produced the shot . xxmaj it was absurd to think that this was the rifle he had been carrying while on the watchtower , because it had not been loaded and had its safety catch down . xxmaj his clothes had not been examined by an expert and it was therefore impossible to conclude whether or nor the shot had been fired at close range . xxmaj the medical expert report was not based on primary medical documents and had thus come to the erroneous conclusion that the bullet had left his body , producing a second wound on his back . xxmaj there were indications , such as the noise of the shot , noted by the witnesses , that he had been wounded by a xxunk and that the bullet had shattered . \n",
       "  32.on 18 xxmaj june 2002 the xxmaj military xxmaj appellate xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office dismissed the appeal . xxmaj it noted that during his interview on 29 xxmaj july 1999 the applicant had stated that he had shot himself . xxmaj moreover , the medical expert had found that he had both an entry and an exit wound . xxmaj the medical documents showed that the wound was from a shot fired at close range . xxmaj xxunk else was around the applicant at the time of the shot . xxmaj the lower prosecutor 's findings were thus correct . \n",
       "  33.on 9 xxmaj july 2002 the applicant appealed to the xxmaj chief xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj he asserted that his statement of 29 xxmaj july 1999 was far from reliable . xxmaj at that time he had been in hospital , in a very bad condition following several lifesaving operations . xxmaj it was therefore surprising to see that the official record of this statement seemed so detailed and logical . xxmaj no expert report had been drawn up on the identity of the firearm which had produced the shot , whereas the evidence showing that it had been fired by his rifle was unreliable and was called into doubt by other evidence . xxmaj there was no evidence showing that the shot had been fired at close range . xxmaj lastly , no consideration had been given to the fact that he had been ordered to take part in the shooting exercises after night duty and while he was ill . \n",
       "  34.on 11 xxmaj october 2002 the xxmaj supreme xxmaj cassation xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office dismissed the appeal . xxmaj it observed that the testing of the piece of skin surrounding the applicant 's entry wound showed that the shot had been fired at close range . xxmaj this was consistent with the applicant 's statement of 29 xxmaj july 1999 and the statement of medical officer xxup n.g. xxmaj it was impossible to examine the bullet , because it had not been found . xxmaj it was established that the spent cartridge case handed over to the investigator by sergeantmajor xxup g.i. did not come from the applicant 's rifle . xxmaj however , it could not be ruled out that xxup g.i. had mistakenly identified it as the one thrown on to the pile by lieutenant xxup m. , given that the pile contained in total more than nine hundred spent cartridge cases . xxmaj even if all of them were to be tested , which was impossible in view of the time elapsed since the events , that would not have led to a definite conclusion about the firearm 's identity . xxmaj the lower prosecutors had thus correctly found that the applicant had injured himself by handling his rifle improperly . xxmaj there was no indication that other soldiers had shot him or that he had injured himself deliberately . \n",
       "  d.the private expert opinion obtained by the applicant in xxmaj june 2003 \n",
       "  35.on 11 xxmaj june 2003 the applicant 's representative before the xxmaj court wrote to xxmaj dr xxup p.l. , the head of the forensic department of the xxmaj pleven xxmaj medical xxmaj university . xxmaj he sent him the relevant medical documents and asked for his opinion on ( a ) whether the description of the applicant 's wound was comprehensive ; ( b ) whether it was possible to determine , on the basis of that description , the distance from which the shot had been fired ; ( c ) what could be the exact basis for such determination ; ( d ) what could be the possibility for error ; and ( e ) what type of data would allow a more precise determination of the distance from which the shot had been fired . \n",
       "  36.dr xxup p.l. 's opinion , drawn up on 13 xxmaj june 2003 , read as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the questions you pose in your letter ... may be answered like this : \n",
       "  1.the description , which says ' visible entry wound in the abdominal area , at the midclavicular line , slightly above the navel , with burns ' , is not detailed – the shape of the wound , the condition of the edges , the size of the wound ( diameter or xxunk ) , the size of the ' burn ' and its position relative to the edges of the wound – xxunk or eccentric – are lacking . \n",
       "  2.on the basis of that description , one could make the very general conclusion that the wound was the result of a shot from a close distance . xxmaj indeed , the shot could have been even a contact one , if it was fired through several layers of clothing , or thicker , or damp clothing . \n",
       "  xxmaj in forensic medicine , shot distances are categorised in three ways : contact shots ( complete or incomplete ) , closedistance shots ( within the range of action of the shot 's additional effects ) , and xxunk shots ( outside the range of action of the shot 's additional effects ) , without this being linked with a concrete distance in centimetres or meters . \n",
       "  3.the basis for the conclusion in point 2 is the fact that the wound was surrounded by a ring , described as a ' burn ' . \n",
       "  4.in the case of closedistance shots ( and sometimes in the case of contact shots ) , one can see traces of unburned powder , metal particles , xxunk , etc . around the wound ( the socalled ' stain ring ' or ' blackened ring ' ) . xxmaj the range at which those can make an impact ( in the case of a shot with a xxmaj kalashnikov rifle ) is twentyfive to thirty centimetres . xxmaj with the increase in the distance , the intensity of those additional effects of the shot diminishes . \n",
       "  xxmaj there is no burning around an entry firearm wound because the action of the flame and the hot gases is short - term . xxmaj sometimes one can find traces of the high xxunk slight burning of thin or more tender hairs or of artificial tissues . \n",
       "  xxmaj the ' stain ring ' around the wound is a result of the mechanical action of the blacks and of the other particles and their ramming into the skin , as well as of the chemical action of the powder gases and the other residues from the shot . \n",
       "  xxmaj it is also possible that the so - called ' burn ' was in fact a ' muzzle mark ' – a bruise around the entry wound resulting from the impact of the muzzle in the case of a full contact shot . xxmaj such marks are characteristic for shots in the head or in areas having a solid surface ( bone ) underneath , but can sometimes occur in cases of shots in the abdominal area . xxmaj the available description does not allow a more specific conclusion to be drawn . \n",
       "  xxmaj the possibility for error when concluding that a shot has been fired from a close distance on the basis of a ' stain ring ' is minimal . xxmaj the medical literature refers to the so - called ' phenomenon of xxmaj vinogradov ' , in which such a ring appears after a shot from a distance of even several hundred meters . xxmaj however , such occurrences are rare and do not correspond to the description of the wound in the present case . xxmaj the description of the wound allows one to conclude that the shot was fired either from a close distance or that it was a contact shot . a long - distance shot is to be excluded . \n",
       "  5.it would be possible to make a more specific assessment of the distance from which the shot has been fired on the basis of : \n",
       "  –a more detailed medical description ( as mentioned in point 1 ) ; \n",
       "  xxunk information about the conditions in which the shot was fired ( clothes , type of bullet , etc . ) ; \n",
       "  –a special analysis determining the composition of the stain around the wound or on the clothes ; \n",
       "  xxunk shots with the same weapon and in the same conditions as the shot under consideration . ” \n",

       "  38.under xxmaj article 237 1 ( 1 ) of the xxmaj code , as in force at the relevant time , prosecutors were to discontinue an investigation if they found that the matters alleged did not amount to a criminal offence . xxmaj until 31 xxmaj december 1999 their decisions to do so could be appealed against before the superior prosecutor ( paragraph 6 of that xxmaj article , as in force until 31 xxmaj december 1999 ) . \n",

       "  51.after leaving xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda the three carabinieri who had been in the jeep went to the casualty department of xxmaj genoa xxmaj hospital . xxup m.p. complained of diffuse bruising to his right leg and an injury to the skull with open wounds ; against the advice of the doctors , who wished to admit him , xxup m.p. signed a discharge and left the hospital at around 9.30 p.m. xxmaj he had an injury to the skull which , he said , had been caused by a blow to the head with a blunt instrument while he had been in the jeep . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk presented with bruising and abrasions to the nose and the right cheekbone and bruises on the left shoulder and left foot . xxup f.c. was suffering from a posttraumatic psychological disorder and was expected to recover within fifteen days . \n",
       "  53.medical examinations were carried out to establish the nature of the injuries and their connection with the attack on the jeep 's occupants . xxmaj the reports concluded that the injuries sustained by xxup m.p. and xxup d.r. had not been life - threatening . xxup m.p. 's head injuries could have been caused by a stone thrown at him , but it was not possible to determine the origin of his other injuries . xxmaj the injury to xxup d.r. 's face could have been caused by a stone thrown at him and his shoulder injury by a blow from a wooden plank . \n",
       "  ( c)the ballistics tests ordered by the public prosecutor 's office \n",
       "  ( i)the first set of tests \n",
       "  54.on 4 xxmaj september 2001 the public prosecutor 's office instructed xxunk to establish whether the two spent cartridges found at the scene ( one in the jeep and the other a few metres from xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body – see paragraph 31 above ) had come from the same weapon , and specifically from xxup m.p. 's weapon . xxmaj in his report of 5 xxmaj december 2001 the expert concluded that there was a 90 % probability that the cartridge found in the jeep had come from xxup m.p. 's pistol , whereas there was only a 10 % probability that the cartridge found close to xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body had issued from the same weapon . xxmaj in accordance with xxmaj article 392 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj criminal xxmaj procedure ( “ the xxup ccp ” ) , these tests were carried out unilaterally , that is to say , without the injured party having an opportunity to participate . \n",
       "  ( ii)the second set of tests \n",
       "  55.the public prosecutor 's office appointed a second expert , police inspector xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the latter , in a report submitted on 15 xxmaj january 2002 , stated that there was a 60 % probability that the spent cartridge found near the victim 's body had come from xxup m.p. 's weapon . xxmaj he concluded that both the cartridges had come from xxup m.p. 's pistol , and estimated the distance between xxup m.p. and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani at the moment of impact at between 110 and 140 centimetres . xxmaj the tests were conducted unilaterally . \n",
       "  ( iii)the third set of tests \n",
       "  56.on 12 xxmaj february 2002 the public prosecutor 's office instructed a panel of experts ( made up of xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj mr xxmaj benedetti , xxmaj mr xxmaj romanini and xxmaj mr xxmaj torre ) “ to reconstruct , even in virtual form , the actions of xxup m.p. and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani in the moments immediately before and after the bullet struck the victim 's body ” . xxmaj in particular , the experts were asked to “ establish the distance between xxup m.p. and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani , their respective angles of vision and xxup m.p. 's field of vision inside the jeep at the moment the shots were fired ” . xxmaj it appears from the file that xxmaj mr xxmaj romanini had published an article in xxmaj september 2001 in a specialist journal ( xxup xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) , in which he expressed the view , among other things , that xxup m.p. 's actions had constituted “ a clear and wholly justified defensive reaction ” . \n",
       "  57.the representatives and experts appointed by the applicants attended the examinations by the panel of experts . xxmaj the applicants ' lawyer , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk , stated that he did not wish to make an application for the immediate production of evidence ( incidente xxunk ) . xxmaj article 392 1 ( f ) and 2 of the xxup ccp allows the public prosecutor and the accused , among other things , to request the investigating judge ( giudice per le indagini preliminari ) to order a forensic examination where the latter concerns a person , object or place which is subject to unavoidable alteration or where , if ordered during the trial , the examination in question could entail suspension of the proceedings for a period exceeding sixty days . xxmaj under xxmaj article 394 of the xxup ccp the injured party may request the public prosecutor to apply for the immediate production of evidence . xxmaj if the public prosecutor refuses the request , he or she must issue an order giving reasons and must serve it on the injured party . \n",
       "  58.an on - site inspection was conducted on 20 xxmaj april 2002 . xxmaj traces of the impact of a shot were found on the wall of a building on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , at a height of about five metres . \n",
       "  59.on 10 xxmaj june 2002 the experts submitted their report . xxmaj the experts stated at the outset that the fact that they had not had access to xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body ( because it had been cremated ) had been a major obstacle which had prevented them from producing an exhaustive report , as they had been unable to re - examine parts of the body and search for micro - traces . xxmaj on the basis of the “ little material available ” the experts attempted to establish first of all what the impact of the bullet had been on xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body , setting out the following considerations . \n",
       "  60.the injuries to the skull had been very serious and had resulted in death “ within a short space of time ” . xxmaj the bullet had not exited whole from xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's head ; the report ( xxunk xxunk ) of the full body scan performed before the autopsy referred to a “ subcutaneous fragment , probably metal ” above the bones in the occipital region . xxmaj this piece of opaque metal looked like a fragment of bullet casing . xxmaj the appearance of the entry wound on the face did not lend itself to an unequivocal interpretation ; its irregular shape was explained chiefly by the type of tissue in the part of the body struck by the bullet . xxmaj however , one possible explanation was that the bullet had not hit xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani directly , but had encountered an intermediate object which could have distorted it and slowed it down before it reached the victim 's body . xxmaj that hypothesis would explain the small dimensions of the exit wound and the fact that the bullet had fragmented inside xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's head . \n",
       "  61.the experts reported finding a small fragment of lead , probably from the bullet , which had come off xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's balaclava when the latter was being handled ; it was impossible to ascertain whether the fragment had come from the front , side or back of the balaclava . xxmaj it bore traces of a substance which was not part of the bullet as such , but came from material used in the building industry . xxmaj in addition , micro - fragments of lead were found on the front and back of the balaclava , apparently confirming the hypothesis that the bullet had lost part of its casing at the moment of impact . xxmaj according to the experts , it was not possible to establish the nature of the “ intermediate object ” apparently hit by the bullet ; however , they ruled out the possibility that it was the fire extinguisher which xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been holding in his outstretched hand . xxmaj the distance from which the shot had been fired had been in excess of 50 - 100 centimetres . \n",
       "  62.in order to reconstruct the events on the basis of the “ intermediate object theory ” , the experts then had some test shots fired and conducted video and computer simulations . xxmaj they concluded that it was not possible to establish the bullet 's trajectory as the latter had undoubtedly been altered as a result of the collision . xxmaj on the basis of video footage showing a stone disintegrating in the air and of the shot that could be heard on the soundtrack , the experts concluded that the stone had shattered immediately after the shot had been fired . a computer simulation showed the bullet , fired upwards , hitting xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani after colliding with the stone in question , thrown at the jeep by another demonstrator . xxmaj the experts estimated that the distance between xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani and the jeep had been approximately 1.75metres and that xxup m.p. had been able to see xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani at the moment the shot was fired . \n",
       "  6.the applicants ' investigations \n",
       "  63.the applicants submitted a statement made to their lawyer by xxup j.m. , one of the demonstrators , on 19 xxmaj february 2002 . xxup j.m. stated in particular that xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had still been alive after the jeep had driven over his body . xxmaj the applicants also produced a statement made by a carabiniere ( xxup v.m. ) , who reported a widespread practice among law - enforcement officers consisting in altering bullets of the kind used by xxup m.p. in order to increase their capacity to expand and hence fragment . \n",
       "  64.lastly , the applicants submitted two reports drawn up by experts they themselves had chosen . xxmaj according to one of the experts , xxmaj mr xxmaj gentile , the bullet had already been in fragments when it struck the victim . xxmaj the fact that it had fragmented could be explained by a manufacturing defect or by its having been manipulated to make it more likely to break up . xxmaj in the expert 's view , however , these two scenarios occurred only rarely and were therefore less likely than the one advanced by the prosecuting authorities ' experts ( namely that the bullet had collided with an intermediate object ) . \n",
       "  65.the other experts appointed by the applicants to reconstruct the events concluded that the stone had shattered on impact with the jeep rather than with the bullet fired by xxup m.p .. xxmaj in order to reconstruct the events on the basis of the audiovisual material , and especially of the photographs , it was necessary to establish the exact position of the photographer , and in particular his or her angle of vision , taking into account also the type of equipment used . xxmaj in addition , it was necessary to establish the timing of the images and how they fitted in with the sound . xxmaj the applicants ' experts criticised the method used by the prosecuting authorities ' experts , who had based their analysis on “ video and computer simulations ” and had not analysed the available images rigorously and in detail . xxmaj the method used to perform the test shots was also criticised . \n",
       "  66.the applicants ' experts concluded that xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been about three metres away from the jeep when the shot was fired . xxmaj while it was undeniable that the fatal bullet had been in fragments when it struck the victim , the possibility of its having collided with the stone which could be seen in the video should be ruled out . a stone would have distorted the bullet differently and left different marks on xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body . xxmaj moreover , xxup m.p. had not fired upwards . \n",
       "  d.the request to discontinue the proceedings and the applicants ' objection \n",
       "  1.the request to discontinue the proceedings \n",
       "  67.on completion of the domestic investigation the xxmaj genoa public prosecutor decided to request that the case against xxup m.p. and xxup f.c. be discontinued . xxmaj the public prosecutor noted first of all that far - reaching changes had been made to the organisation of the public - order operations on the night of 19 xxmaj july 2001 , and took the view that this partly explained the problems that had arisen on 20 xxmaj july . xxmaj however , he did not detail the changes or the problems that had resulted . \n",
       "  68.the public prosecutor went on to observe that xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro 's version of events and that of xxmaj captain xxmaj cappello differed on one specific point : whereas the former asserted that the decision to position law - enforcement personnel on xxmaj via xxmaj caffa in order to block the demonstrators had been taken by mutual agreement , the latter maintained that it had been a unilateral decision taken by xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro despite the risks entailed by the small size of the detachment and the fact that the men were tired . \n",
       "  69.the experts agreed on the following points : two shots had been fired from xxup m.p. 's pistol , the first of which had killed xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ; the bullet in question had not fragmented solely as a result of striking the victim ; and the photograph of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani holding the fire extinguisher had been taken when he was approximately three metres away from the jeep . \n",
       "  70.however , they differed on the following points : \n",
       "  ( a)according to the prosecuting authorities ' experts , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been 1.75 metres from the jeep when the bullet struck him ( approximately three metres away according to the xxmaj giuliani family 's experts ) ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk to the xxmaj giuliani family 's experts , the shot had been fired before the stone could be seen on the video , contrary to the view of the prosecuting authorities ' experts . \n",
       "  71.as the parties agreed that the bullet had fragmented before striking the victim , the public prosecutor concluded that they were also in agreement as to the causes of the bullet 's fragmentation , and that the applicants subscribed to the “ intermediate object theory ” . xxmaj other possible explanations for the fragmentation of the bullet advanced by the applicants – such as the manipulation of the bullet or a manufacturing defect – had been considered by the applicants themselves to be much less likely . xxmaj they could not therefore be regarded as valid explanations in the public prosecutor 's view . \n",
       "  72.the investigation had been lengthy , in particular owing to delays with some of the forensic reports , the “ superficial nature ” of the autopsy report and the errors committed by one of the experts , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj however , it had addressed all the relevant issues in detail and led to the conclusion that the hypothesis of the bullet having been fired upwards and deflected by a stone was “ the most convincing ” . xxmaj nevertheless , there was insufficient evidence in the file to determine whether xxup m.p. had fired with the sole intention of dispersing the demonstrators or had knowingly run the risk of injuring or killing one or more of them . xxmaj there were three possibilities , and “ the matter [ would ] never be resolved with certainty ” . xxmaj the possibilities were as follows : \n",
       "  –the shots had been designed to intimidate the demonstrators and it was therefore a case of causing death by negligence ; \n",
       "  xxup –m.p. had fired the shots in order to put a stop to the attack and had accepted the risk of killing someone ; that would mean that it was a case of intentional homicide ; \n",
       "  xxup –m.p. had aimed at xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ; this would also be intentional homicide . \n",
       "  xxmaj in the public prosecutor 's view , the evidence in the file was such that the third possibility could be ruled out . \n",
       "  73.the public prosecutor further considered that the fact that the bullet had collided with the stone was not capable of severing the causal link between xxup m.p. 's actions and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death . xxmaj given that the link remained , the question was whether xxup m.p. had acted in self - defence . \n",
       "  74 . xxmaj it had been proven that the physical integrity of the jeep 's occupants had been under threat and that xxup m.p. had been “ responding ” in the face of danger . xxmaj that response had to be examined in terms of both its necessity and its proportionality , “ the latter aspect being the more delicate ” . \n",
       "  75.the public prosecutor took the view that xxup m.p. had had no other option and could not have been expected to act differently , since “ the jeep was surrounded by demonstrators [ and ] the physical aggression against the occupants was patent and virulent ” . xxup m.p. had been justified in perceiving his life to be in danger . xxmaj the pistol had been a tool capable of putting a stop to the attack , and xxup m.p. could not be criticised for the equipment issued to him . xxmaj he could not be expected to refrain from using his weapon and submit to an attack liable to endanger his physical integrity . xxmaj these considerations justified a decision to discontinue the case . \n",
       "  2.the applicants ' objection \n",
       "  76.on 10 xxmaj december 2002 the applicants lodged an objection against the public prosecutor 's request to discontinue the proceedings . xxmaj they alleged that , since the prosecuting authorities themselves had acknowledged that the investigation had been flawed and raised questions which had not been answered with certainty , adversarial proceedings were essential in order to arrive at the truth . xxmaj in their view , it was impossible to argue simultaneously that xxup m.p. had fired into the air and that he had acted in self - defence , particularly since he had said that he could not see xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani when he had fired the shots . \n",
       "  77.the applicants further remarked that the intermediate object theory , which they disputed , had been put forward one year after the events and was based on pure supposition not backed up by objective evidence . xxmaj there were other possible explanations . \n",
       "  78.the applicants also observed that , according to the evidence in the file , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had still been alive after the jeep had driven over his body . xxmaj they stressed that the autopsy report , which found that no appreciable injuries had been caused by the jeep driving over the body , had been described by the public prosecutor as superficial ; they also criticised the decision to entrust a number of investigative measures to the carabinieri . \n",
       "  79.it followed that xxup m.p. and xxup f.c. should have been committed for trial . xxmaj in the alternative , the applicants requested that further investigative measures be undertaken , in particular : \n",
       "  ( a)that a forensic report be prepared aimed at establishing the causes and the time of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death , in order to ascertain in particular whether he had still been alive when the jeep drove over his body , and afterwards ; \n",
       "  ( b)that evidence be heard from the chief of police , xxmaj mr xxmaj de xxmaj gennaro , and from carabiniere xxmaj zappia , to establish what instructions had been given regarding the wearing of weapons on the thigh ; \n",
       "  ( c)that the person who had thrown the stone which allegedly deflected the bullet be identified and traced ; \n",
       "  ( d)that further evidence be heard from the demonstrators who had come forward ; \n",
       "  ( e)that evidence be heard from the carabiniere xxup v.m. , who had reported the practice of cutting the tips of bullets ( see paragraph 63 above ) ; \n",
       "  ( f)that forensic tests be carried out on the spent cartridges and on the weapons of all the police and carabinieri on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda at the time of the events . \n",
       "  3.the hearing before the investigating judge \n",
       "  80.the hearing before the investigating judge took place on 17 xxmaj april 2003 . xxmaj the applicants maintained their argument that the fatal bullet had not been deflected but had struck the victim directly . xxmaj however , they conceded that there was no evidence that xxup m.p. had altered the bullet to increase its impact ; that was simply one theory . \n",
       "  81.the representative of the public prosecutor 's office said he had the impression that “ certain points which [ he had ] believed to be the subject of agreement were in fact not ; on the contrary , there were divergences of opinion ” . xxmaj he pointed out that the applicants ' expert , xxmaj mr xxmaj gentile , had been in agreement as to the fact that the bullet had been damaged before striking xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj mr xxmaj gentile had acknowledged that one of the possible causes of the damage was a collision with some object or an intrinsic defect in the bullet , and that the second cause was less likely than the first . \n",
       "  e.the decision of the investigating judge \n",
       "  82.by an order lodged with the registry on 5 xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj genoa investigating judge granted the public prosecutor 's request to discontinue the case . \n",
       "  1.establishment of the facts \n",
       "  83.the investigating judge referred to an anonymous account of the events posted by a xxmaj french person on an anarchist website ( xxunk ) , which she considered to be credible given that it concurred with the audiovisual material and with the witness statements . xxmaj the account in question described the situation on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda and a charge by demonstrators against the carabinieri . xxmaj the charge had been led by demonstrators throwing anything that came to hand , followed by others carrying containers and rubbish bins for use as mobile barricades . xxmaj the atmosphere on the square was described as “ xxunk ” , with the lawenforcement agencies coming under attack from a crowd which was advancing , throwing missiles and immediately picking up new ones . xxmaj the carabinieri , for their part , were firing tear gas , but a contingent was eventually forced to retreat towards xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , where one of the two jeeps accompanying them found itself xxunk in and surrounded by demonstrators . xxmaj the latter , brandishing iron bars and other objects , began hitting the jeep , and the rear window was soon smashed . xxmaj the author of the account heard two shots and could see the hand of one of the two carabinieri inside the jeep , holding a firearm . xxmaj when the jeep drove off and the noise died down , he saw a young man with serious head injuries lying on the ground . xxmaj the author also described the anger of certain demonstrators on learning that a demonstrator had died . \n",
       "  84.the investigating judge observed that the description by the anonymous demonstrator tallied with the findings of the investigation , according to which , at around 5 p.m. , a group of demonstrators had gathered in xxmaj via xxmaj caffa at the junction with xxmaj via xxmaj tolemaide , erecting barricades using rubbish bins , supermarket trolleys and other objects . xxmaj from behind this barricade the group began throwing large numbers of stones and hard objects at a contingent of carabinieri who , having been stationed originally on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda at the corner of xxmaj via xxmaj caffa , had begun to move forward in a bid to stop the demonstrators , whose numbers had increased in the meantime . xxmaj two jeeps , one of them driven by xxup f.c. and with xxup m.p. and xxup d.r. on board , joined the contingent of carabinieri ; however , the demonstrators charged violently , forcing the contingent to retreat . xxmaj the jeeps reversed towards xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , where one of them collided with a refuse container . xxmaj in a matter of moments , the demonstrators surrounded the vehicle , hitting it using all available means and throwing stones . xxmaj as the audiovisual material in the file showed , the jeep 's windows were smashed with stones , iron bars and sticks . xxmaj the unrelenting nature of the demonstrators ' attack on the jeep was described as “ impressive ” . xxmaj some stones struck members of the carabinieri in the face and the head and one demonstrator , xxmaj mr xxmaj monai , thrust a long wooden beam through one of the windows , with the result that xxup d.r. sustained bruises and grazing to his right shoulder . \n",
       "  xxunk of the photographs showed xxup m.p. kicking a fire extinguisher away ; this was very probably the metal object which had caused severe bruising to his leg . xxmaj successive photographs showed a hand holding a weapon above the jeep 's spare wheel while a young man ( xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ) reached down to the ground and picked up a fire extinguisher , in all likelihood with the intention of throwing it at the jeep 's rear window . xxmaj at that moment two shots were fired from inside the jeep and the young man fell to the ground . xxmaj the jeep drove over his body twice before managing to leave the scene . \n",
       "  xxunk the available evidence , including xxup m.p. 's statement of 20 xxmaj july 2001 ( see paragraphs 34 - 36 above ) , indicated that xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death had been caused by one of the shots fired by xxup m.p. xxmaj the investigating judge cited virtually the whole of that statement , in which xxup m.p. spoke of his state of panic , the injuries he and xxup d.r. had sustained and the fact that at the moment he pointed his pistol he had not seen anyone but had been aware of the presence of attackers because of the continuous barrage of stones . xxmaj that version matched the statements made by xxup d.r. and xxup f.c. and those of other armed forces personnel and witnesses . xxmaj in addition , the case file showed that xxup m.p. had bruising and injuries to his right leg , his arm and the top of his skull ; xxup d.r. had scratches on his face and bruising on his shoulder and foot , while xxup f.c. had a post - traumatic disorder treatable within fifteen days ( see paragraphs 51 - 53 above ) . \n",
       "  2.the “ intermediate object ” theory \n",
       "  87.the investigating judge noted that the evidence in the file showed that the first bullet fired by xxup m.p. had killed xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj in exiting through the occipital bone in the skull the bullet had lost a fragment of its casing , as shown by the scan performed before the autopsy . xxmaj this fact , combined with the characteristics of the entry and exit wounds , had led the prosecuting authorities ' experts to formulate the theory that the bullet had collided with an object before hitting xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj the entry wound had been very irregular in shape and the exit wound had been small , as was the case when a bullet had lost momentum and / or fragmented . \n",
       "  88.the bullet in question was an encased 9 mm parabellum , and therefore very powerful . xxmaj this fact , together with the low resistance of the body tissue through which the bullet had travelled , served to confirm the theory advanced by the prosecuting authorities ' experts . xxmaj moreover , a “ tiny fragment of lead ” , compatible with the bullets issued to xxup m.p. , had been found in the victim 's balaclava with particles of bone attached to it . xxmaj this suggested that the bullet had lost part of its casing before hitting the bone . \n",
       "  89.the simulated shots had revealed that the intermediate object which caused the bullet to fragment could not have been either the fire extinguisher carried by the victim or one of the bones through which the bullet had passed ; on the other hand , it could have been one of the numerous stones thrown at the jeep by demonstrators . xxmaj this appeared to be confirmed by the video footage showing a stone disintegrating in the air at the same time as a shot was heard . xxmaj the fact that the sound and the disintegration of the object occurred simultaneously made the applicants ' theory that the stone had smashed on impact with the roof of the jeep less convincing . xxmaj furthermore , the lead fragment in the victim 's balaclava had borne traces of building materials . xxmaj lastly , the test shots had shown that , when they were hit by a bullet , objects made up of building materials “ exploded ” in a similar manner to that seen in the video footage and caused damage to the cartridge casing . xxmaj the tests performed showed that disintegration occurred differently when such objects were thrown against a vehicle ( the dust was produced after rather than simultaneously with fragmentation , and in smaller quantities ) . \n",
       "  90.the second shot fired by xxup m.p. had left a mark on the wall of the church on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda ( at a height of 5.3 metres ) . xxmaj the first shot had hit xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj the ballistics tests had been unable to establish the original trajectory of that bullet . xxmaj however , the experts appointed by the public prosecutor 's office had taken into account the fact that the jeep was xxunk high and that the stone seen on the video had been at a height of around 1.9 m when the image was recorded . xxmaj they had therefore fired some test shots , positioning the weapon around 1.3 metres from a stone suspended 1.9 metres above the ground : the bullet had been deflected downwards and hit the “ collecting tray ” ( located 1.75 metres from the weapon ) at heights of between 1.1 and 1.8 metres . xxmaj these data tallied with the statements of certain demonstrators who had been eyewitnesses to the events , according to whom xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been about two metres from the jeep when he was shot dead . xxmaj the prosecuting authorities ' experts had not had these statements available to them at the time they had carried out their work . \n",
       "  91.the foregoing considerations suggested that , as concluded by the prosecuting authorities ' experts , the shot had been fired upwards , above xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani , who was 1.65 m tall . xxmaj the stone had disintegrated 1.9 metres above the ground . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk 's angle of vision \n",
       "  xxup xxunk 's angle of vision had probably been restricted by the jeep 's spare wheel . xxmaj however , it was difficult to be certain on that point as xxup m.p. 's face did not appear on any of the photographs in the file , whereas they clearly showed his hand holding the weapon . xxmaj the pictures suggested , however , that he had been half - lying ( in xxunk xxunk ) or crouching on the floor , as confirmed by xxup m.p. 's own statements and those of xxup d.r. and the demonstrator xxmaj predonzani . xxmaj that led to the conclusion that xxup m.p. had been unable to see the persons close to the jeep 's rear door below the spare wheel , and that he had fired the shots in an attempt to intimidate the demonstrators . \n",
       "  4.legal characterisation of xxup m.p. 's actions \n",
       "  xxunk thus reconstructed the facts , the investigating judge addressed the legal characterisation of xxup m.p. 's actions . xxmaj the prosecuting authorities had advanced two hypotheses in that regard ( see paragraph 72 above ) : ( a ) that xxup m.p. had fired as high in the air as possible with the sole aim of intimidating the jeep 's assailants , in which case the charge should be one of causing death by negligence ( omicidio xxunk ) ; ( b ) that xxup m.p. had fired without aiming at anyone or anything , with the aim of halting the attack , in which case the charge should be one of intentional homicide on account of “ reckless conduct ” , as he had accepted the risk that demonstrators might be hit . \n",
       "  94.the investigating judge took the view that the first hypothesis advanced by the public prosecutor was not correct . xxmaj if xxup m.p. had fired as high in the air as possible his actions would not have been punishable , by virtue of xxmaj article 53 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ( “ the xxup cc ” ) , and the causal link would in any case have been severed by an unforeseeable factor beyond his control , namely the bullet 's collision with an intermediate object . \n",
       "  95.if , on the other hand , the second hypothesis advanced by the prosecuting authorities was accepted , it had to be established whether any grounds of justification existed ( the legitimate use of weapons and / or selfdefence , under xxmaj articles 53 and 52 of the xxup cc – see paragraphs 142 - 144 below ) which would exempt xxup m.p. from criminal responsibility and make his actions not punishable . \n",
       "  5.whether xxup m.p. made legitimate use of his weapon ( xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc ) \n",
       "  96.the investigating judge first addressed the question whether the use of a weapon had been necessary . xxmaj under xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc ( see xxunk below ) , xxmaj state agents had wider powers than ordinary individuals in the context of self - defence ; this ground of justification was not subject to the condition that the reaction was proportionate to the threat , but to the condition of “ necessity ” . xxmaj even for xxmaj state agents , the use of a weapon was a measure of last resort ( xxunk ratio ) ; however , xxmaj state agents could not be held responsible for the occurrence of a more serious event than that foreseen by them , as this risk was inherent in the use of firearms . xxmaj in general terms , xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc permitted the use of force where it was necessary to repel violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk had found himself in a situation of extreme violence designed to disturb public order and targeting the carabinieri , whose safety was directly threatened . xxmaj in that connection the investigating judge cited extracts from the testimonies of two of the jeep 's assailants ( xxmaj mr xxmaj predonzani and xxunk ) , noting once again the violence of the assault , and referred to the photographs in the file . xxmaj the victim 's conduct had not been an isolated act of aggression , but one phase in a violent attack on the jeep by several persons , who had been xxunk it sideways and probably trying to open the rear door . \n",
       "  98.the evidence in the file ruled out the possibility that xxup m.p. had deliberately targeted xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ; however , even assuming that this had been the case , in the particular circumstances of the case his conduct would have been justified under xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc , as it was legitimate to fire in the direction of assailants in order to halt an attack while endeavouring to limit the damage , for instance by avoiding vital organs . xxmaj in conclusion , the use of a firearm had been justified and had been likely not to cause serious harm , given that xxup m.p. had “ certainly fired upwards ” and that the bullet had struck xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani only because it had been deflected in a manner that could not have been foreseen . \n",
       "  xxunk xxup m.p. acted in self - defence ( xxmaj article 52 of the xxup cc ) \n",
       "  99.the investigating judge next considered it necessary to determine whether xxup m.p. had acted in self - defence , which was a “ more stringent ” test for exemption from responsibility . xxmaj she took the view that xxup m.p. had rightly perceived a threat to his physical integrity and that of his colleagues , and that the threat had persisted on account of the violent attack on the jeep by a crowd of assailants and not just by xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj in order to be assessed in its proper context , xxup m.p. 's response had to be viewed in relation to that attack . xxmaj the investigating judge rejected the hypothesis advanced by the victim 's family that xxup m.p. 's head injuries had been caused by the internal lever of the flashing light on the jeep 's roof rather than by stones thrown by demonstrators . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk 's response had been necessary in view of the number of assailants , the means used , the sustained nature of the violence , the injuries to the carabinieri in the jeep and the vehicle 's difficulty in leaving the square because the engine had stalled . xxmaj the response had been appropriate given the level of violence . \n",
       "  xxunk xxup m.p. not taken out his weapon and fired two shots , the attack would have continued . xxmaj if the fire extinguisher – which xxup m.p. had already kicked away once – had landed in the jeep , it would have caused serious injury , or worse , to the occupants . xxmaj as to the relationship of proportionality between the attack and the response , the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation had held that the interests under threat had to be weighed against the means available to the accused , and that a plea of self - defence might be allowed even if the harm to the assailant was slightly greater than the threatened harm to the accused ( see xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , xxmaj first xxmaj section , judgment no . xxunk of 13april 1987 , xxmaj catania ) . xxmaj furthermore , the response had to be the only one possible in the circumstances , in the sense that other responses less damaging to the assailant would not suffice to counter the danger ( see xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , xxmaj first xxmaj section , judgment no . xxunk of 1 xxmaj december 1995 , xxup p.m. and xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj where a firearm was the only means of defence available to the person under attack , its use should be confined to displaying the person 's resolve to make use of it , firing into the air or onto the ground or firing in the direction of the assailant but taking care not to hit vital organs , so as to inflict injury but not kill ( see xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation judgment of 20september 1982 , xxmaj xxunk ) . \n",
       "  102.in the instant case xxup m.p. had had only one means of countering the attack : his firearm . xxmaj he had made proportionate use of it , since before shooting he had called out to the demonstrators to leave , in an attempt to put a stop to their actions ; he had then fired upwards and the bullet had hit the victim as the result of a tragic twist of fate ( per una xxunk xxunk ) . xxmaj had he wished to be sure of harming his assailants he would have fired through the side windows of the jeep , next to which numerous demonstrators had gathered . xxmaj it followed that he had acted in self - defence . xxmaj that being so , it was of little relevance whether xxup m.p. had had a partial view of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ( as the applicants ' experts maintained and the prosecuting authorities ' experts considered possible ) or whether , as seemed more likely , he had not seen him and had fired as high in the air as his position would allow , accepting the risk that the shot might hit somebody . \n",
       "  7.the accusations against xxup f.c. \n",
       "  103.the investigating judge also considered that the evidence in the file excluded any criminal responsibility on the part of xxup f.c. , given that , as indicated by the forensic experts , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death had undoubtedly been caused within minutes by the pistol shot . xxmaj the jeep 's driving over the victim 's body had caused only bruising . xxmaj in any event , owing to the confused situation around the jeep , xxup f.c. had not been able to see xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani or observe that he had fallen to the ground . \n",
       "  xxunk of the applicants ' requests for further investigation \n",
       "  104.the investigating judge refused all the applicants ' requests for further investigative measures to be taken ( see paragraph 79 above ) . xxmaj the reasons for the refusal can be summarised as follows : \n",
       "  ( a)with regard to the request for a forensic report to be prepared aimed at establishing whether xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had still been alive when the jeep drove over his body ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) , the checks already carried out had been thorough ; furthermore , the injured parties had been offered the opportunity of appointing an expert of their choosing to attend the autopsy , but had not availed themselves of that possibility . xxmaj in addition , the victim 's body had been cremated scarcely three days after his death , thereby rendering any subsequent examination impossible ; \n",
       "  ( b)as to the request for police chief xxmaj de xxmaj gennaro and carabinieri second lieutenant xxmaj zappia to be examined on the subject of the lawfulness of the use of “ thigh xxunk ” of the kind from which xxup m.p. had drawn the weapon ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) , it was clear that the directives issued with a view to the maintenance of public order could only be of a general nature and did not include instructions applying to unforeseeable situations involving direct attacks on officers . xxmaj furthermore , the manner in which xxup m.p. had been wearing the pistol was of no relevance in the present case given that he could legitimately make use of his weapon irrespective of where he was wearing it or where he drew it from ; \n",
       "  ( c)any attempt to identify the person who had thrown the stone which deflected the bullet ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) was bound to fail , as it was not realistic to imagine that a demonstrator would have followed the trajectory of a stone after throwing it . xxmaj in any event , it would be impossible to identify the person concerned and his or her statements would have no bearing on the technical findings in the judge 's possession ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk purpose whatsoever would be served by further examining the demonstrators xxmaj monai and xxmaj predonzani concerning the conduct of the carabinieri inside the jeep , the number of demonstrators in the vicinity of the vehicle , the person inside the jeep who had actually seized the weapon , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's position or the number of the jeep 's windows that were broken ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) . xxmaj those witnesses had made statements very shortly after the events , while the latter were still fresh in their minds ; the statements contained extremely precise details which were confirmed by the video footage and photographs in the file . xxmaj lastly , it was not relevant to establish how many of the jeep 's windows had been broken as it was beyond dispute that some of the right - side windows and the rear window were smashed ; \n",
       "  ( e)it was unnecessary to take evidence from xxmaj mr d'auria , supposedly to confirm that no xxmaj molotov cocktails had been thrown on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , contrary to xxup m.p. 's assertion , or to determine how far away xxmaj mr d'auria had been when he took the photograph which the prosecuting authorities ' experts had used as a basis for the ballistics reconstruction . xxmaj the photograph in question had been merely a starting point for determining carlogiuliani 's position , which had been deduced from the position of the persons in relation to the fixed elements on the square . xxmaj furthermore , xxup m.p. had never asserted that xxmaj molotov cocktails had been thrown on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda ; he had simply spoken of his fear that they might be ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk regard to the request to hear evidence from xxmaj sergeant - xxmaj major xxmaj xxunk as to when the xxunk window of the jeep had been smashed , the photographs showed clearly that it had happened well before the shots were fired and that the latter had not been the cause of the smashed window ; even if the witness whom the applicants wished to see called perceived the matter differently , this would not alter those findings ; \n",
       "  ( g)the footage recorded on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda by two carabinieri whose helmets were equipped with video cameras was already in the file ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk was nothing to be gained by hearing evidence from carabiniere xxup v.m. concerning the practice of cutting the tips of bullets ( see xxunk ) above ) . xxmaj it could only be assumed that this improper practice was not widespread ; in any event , the findings of the ballistics reports , based on objective tests , were already available . xxmaj there was nothing to indicate that xxup m.p. had adopted the practice in question in this case , given that the other bullets found in the magazine of his pistol had been perfectly normal ; \n",
       "  ( i)it was beyond dispute that the damage to the jeep had been caused by the stones and other hard objects thrown at it ; it was therefore unnecessary to order a technical inspection of the vehicle ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk tests on the spent cartridges seized , in order to establish which weapons they had come from ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) , would “ serve no actual purpose ” , as there was no doubt that the fatal bullet had been fired from xxup m.p. 's weapon ; this had been confirmed by xxup m.p. 's statements and the findings of the forensic examinations . \n",
       "  9.the decision to delegate certain investigative steps to the carabinieri \n",
       "  105.the investigating judge dismissed the criticisms made by the applicants ' lawyers to the effect that it had been inappropriate to entrust several aspects of the investigation to the carabinieri and to hear evidence from a large number of witnesses in the presence of members of the carabinieri . xxmaj the judge observed that the events on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda had been reconstructed with the aid of the large volume of video and photographic material in the file and the statements of the participants themselves , and that all plausible scenarios had been considered . \n",
       "  106.in the light of all the above considerations the xxmaj genoa investigating judge decided that the proceedings should be discontinued . \n",
       "  f.the parliamentary inquiry \n",
       "  107.on 2 xxmaj august 2001 the xxmaj speakers of the xxmaj senate and the xxmaj chamber of xxmaj deputies decided that an inquiry ( indagine xxunk ) into the events which occurred during the xxup g8 in xxmaj genoa should be carried out by the constitutional affairs committees of both houses of xxmaj parliament . xxmaj to that end , a commission representing the different parliamentary groups was established , made up of eighteen members of xxmaj parliament and the same number of senators ( “ the parliamentary commission ” ) . \n",
       "  108.on 8 xxmaj august 2001 the parliamentary commission heard evidence from the xxmaj commander - xxmaj general of the carabinieri . xxmaj the latter stated , in particular , that xxunk additional troops and 375 specialised carabinieri had been drafted in to xxmaj genoa to assist the 1,200 members of the provincial command . xxmaj only 27 % of the men present in xxmaj genoa had been auxiliary carabinieri performing military service ( for public - order operations the figure was usually 70 % ) . xxmaj most of the auxiliary carabinieri had performed nine or ten months ' service and had already been deployed in similar settings . xxmaj beginning in xxmaj april 2001 all the personnel to be deployed in xxmaj genoa had received training in public - order operations and use of the standard equipment . xxmaj team exercises and seminars had been organised , the latter relating to the identification of potential threats and the layout of the city . xxmaj all those deployed had protective helmets , riot shields , batons , gas masks and xxunk suits with protection for the most exposed parts of the body . xxmaj each carabiniere had a pistol ( xxunk xxunk ) and numerous tear - gas grenades had been issued to the detachments ; there were also 100 armoured vehicles and 226 vehicles equipped with protective grilles , in addition to the special vehicles ( for instance , vehicles fitted with mobile barriers to reinforce the fixed barriers protecting the red zone ) . \n",
       "  109.according to a memorandum from the senior command of the carabinieri , an elite force ( xxunk xxunk ) of xxunk men had undergone a programme of training in xxmaj velletri ahead of the xxup g8 summit , covering both theory ( the psychology of crowds and opposition groups , public - order techniques , handling emergencies ) and practice ( physical activity , use of resources , materials and equipment , final exercise with debriefing ) . xxmaj the remaining troops had received three days ' training in public - order techniques . xxmaj forty - eight officers had taken part in an information seminar covering topics such as the layout of the city of xxmaj genoa . \n",
       "  110.on 5 xxmaj september 2001 the parliamentary commission heard evidence from xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro , an officer of the xxmaj rome police who had taken part in the public - order operations in xxmaj genoa ( see paragraph 34 above ) . \n",
       "  xxunk xxmaj lauro stated that the carabinieri had been equipped with throat microphones , enabling them to communicate very rapidly with one another . xxmaj when asked to explain why the law - enforcement officers stationed quite near to the jeep ( fifteen to twenty metres away ) had not intervened , xxunk replied that the men had been on duty since the morning and had been involved in several clashes during the day . xxmaj he added that he had not noticed at the time of the events that there was a group of carabinieri and police officers who could have intervened . \n",
       "  xxunk to the function of the two jeeps , xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro explained that they had brought fresh supplies at around 4 p.m. and had left and then returned about an hour later to see if anyone was injured . xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro also said that he had called an ambulance for xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani as no doctor was present at the scene . \n",
       "  113.on 20 xxmaj september 2001 the parliamentary commission submitted a report setting out the conclusions of the majority of its members following the inquiry . xxmaj the document dealt with the organisation of the xxup g8 in xxmaj genoa , the political context and protest movements surrounding the summit and similar events worldwide , and the numerous contacts which had taken place between representatives of the institutions and associations making up the xxmaj genoa xxmaj social xxmaj forum , with the aim of preventing public - order disturbances and making arrangements to receive the demonstrators . xxmaj despite that dialogue , the protest movement had not succeeded in isolating the violent elements , numbering “ around 10,000 ” ; within the latter , a distinction had to be made between the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc and “ opportunistic ” individuals who had concealed themselves in the crowd . \n",
       "  xxunk thousand law - enforcement officers had taken part in the operation . xxmaj there had been about 2,000 delegates and xxunk accredited journalists ; the number of demonstrators ran into the tens of thousands ( 100,000 had taken part in the final demonstration ) . xxmaj seminars on the coordination and training of the law - enforcement agencies ( with contributions by trainers from the xxmaj los xxmaj xxunk police ) had been held on 24april and 18 and 19 xxmaj june 2001 . xxmaj the agencies concerned had staged practical exercises , albeit after a deplorable delay . xxmaj the administrative authorities had conducted research into non - lethal ammunition ( including rubber bullets ) , in particular by means of study visits to foreign police forces . xxmaj the authorities had been informed that xxmaj black xxmaj bloc demonstrators from anarchist circles in xxmaj italy and abroad were likely to travel to xxmaj genoa . xxmaj after contacts with police forces in other countries , a decision had been taken to suspend application of the xxmaj schengen xxmaj agreements between 13 and 21 xxmaj july 2001 . xxmaj from 14 xxmaj july onwards checks had been carried out at the xxmaj italian borders to allow certain demonstrators to enter the country and prevent violent elements from gaining access . xxmaj in the meantime , by an order dated 12 xxmaj july 2001 , the xxmaj genoa questore had indicated the areas of the city where the summit and the demonstrations would take place and had given an analytical breakdown of the security measures in place in each area . \n",
       "  115.the parliamentary commission next examined the various violent incidents and clashes which had taken place between the law - enforcement agencies and demonstrators on 19 , 20 and 21 xxmaj july 2001 ( in particular during a search conducted in a school , described by the commission as “ perhaps the most notable example of organisational and operational failings ” ) . xxmaj with specific reference to the death of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani , the commission observed that a carabiniere had fired the fatal shot while the victim had been preparing to throw a fire extinguisher in his direction ; the carabiniere in question had previously sustained a blow to the head from another demonstrator . xxmaj in view of the fact that a criminal investigation was in progress , the commission decided to focus its analysis on the “ overall situation giving rise to the tragedy ” , examining in particular the communications system between the contingents of law - enforcement personnel , their commanding officers and the control centres , in order to study the coordination arrangements between the different areas . xxmaj the commission also noted that the “ fundamental cause ” of the loss of a life had been “ the xxunk violence perpetrated by extremist groups which jeopardised the lives of the young people who became caught up in their criminal activities ” . \n",
       "  116.in the commission 's view , the overall outcome of the xxup g8 had been positive . xxmaj while certain shortcomings had been identified in the coordination of the operations , it had to be borne in mind that the law - enforcement agencies had been confronted with between 6,000 and 9,000 violent individuals who had not been isolated by the peaceful demonstrators ( the commission referred in that regard to the “ double game ” being played by the xxmaj genoa xxmaj social xxmaj forum ) . xxmaj the parliamentary commission 's report concluded as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the commission ... reiterates that violence is not and must not be a tool for political action and that the rule of law is a fundamental value of democratic societies . xxmaj at the same time it emphasises strongly the inviolability of the constitutional principles of freedom to express one 's thoughts and respect for the individual even – not to say especially – where he or she is detained following arrest , and also the need to ensure the safety of citizens and public order ; if acts constituting a criminal or disciplinary offence are established , [ the commission ] would like to see the judicial authority and the administrative bodies concerned identify those responsible and punish their actions . ” \n",
       "  117.the xxmaj government produced before the xxmaj court the verbatim records of the hearings at which the parliamentary commission had heard evidence from the xxmaj minister of the xxmaj interior , the xxmaj director - xxmaj general of the xxmaj public xxmaj safety xxmaj department and the xxmaj commander - xxmaj general of the xxmaj revenue xxmaj police . \n",
       "  118.on 20 xxmaj september 2001 a group of parliamentarians called on the government to explain why law - enforcement officers being deployed on public - order operations were equipped with live ammunition rather than rubber bullets . xxmaj the parliamentarians advocated the use of the latter , arguing that they had been used successfully on several occasions in other countries . \n",
       "  119.the government spokesman replied that the legislation made no provision for that option and that , moreover , it had not been proven that rubber bullets did not also cause very serious harm to the victim . xxmaj finally , he said that the possibility of introducing non - lethal weapons was currently being examined . \n",
       "  120.on 22 xxmaj june 2006 the applicants applied to the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister 's xxmaj office and to the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj defence for compensation in respect of the damage they had suffered as a result of the death of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj the xxmaj government explained that the application had been refused on the ground that it had been established in criminal proceedings that xxup m.p. had acted in self - defence . xxmaj for the same reason , no disciplinary proceedings were instituted against xxup m.p. \n",
       "  g.the decisions given in the “ trial of the twenty - five ” \n",
       "  1.the first - instance judgment \n",
       "  121.on 13 xxmaj march 2008 the xxmaj genoa xxmaj district xxmaj court published its reasoning in the judgment adopted on 14 xxmaj december 2007 following the trial of twenty - five demonstrators charged with a number of offences committed on 20 xxmaj july 2001 ( including criminal damage , theft , destroying property , looting and acts of violence against law - enforcement officers ) . xxmaj during the trial , in which 144 hearings were held , the xxmaj district xxmaj court , among other things , heard evidence from numerous witnesses and examined a wealth of audiovisual material . \n",
       "  122.the xxmaj district xxmaj court held , inter alia , that the attack by carabinieri on the xxmaj tute xxmaj bianche marchers had been unlawful and arbitrary . xxmaj the march had been authorised and the demonstrators had not committed any significant acts of violence against the carabinieri . xxmaj the attack by the latter had been launched against hundreds of persons who were doing no harm , and no order to disperse had been given . xxmaj the subsequent charge had also been unlawful and arbitrary . xxmaj it had not been preceded by a warning to disperse , had not been ordered by the officer authorised to do so and had been unnecessary . \n",
       "  123.the methods deployed had also been unlawful . xxmaj the carabinieri had fired tear - gas grenades at chest height , a large number of demonstrators had sustained injuries caused by non - regulation batons , and the armoured vehicles had knocked down the barricades and pursued members of the crowd along the pavement with the clear intention of causing harm . \n",
       "  124.the unlawful and arbitrary nature of the carabinieri 's actions had justified the resistance shown by the demonstrators while tear gas was being used and during the attack on the march . xxmaj their resistance had also been warranted during the clashes which occurred in the side streets prior to 3.30p.m . , that is , up to the point at which the carabinieri had acted on the order to stop and allow the march to proceed . xxmaj according to the court , the accused 's actions had been a “ necessary response ” to the arbitrary actions of the law - enforcement officers for the purposes of xxmaj article 4 of xxmaj legislative xxmaj decree no . 288 of 1944 . xxmaj article 4 reads as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj articles 336 , 337 , 338 , 339 , 341 , 342 and 343 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code [ making punishable various acts of resistance against law - enforcement officers ] shall not apply where the xxmaj state agent or person authorised to exercise public authority caused the offence contemplated in those xxmaj articles by overstepping the limits of his or her authority through arbitrary acts . ” \n",
       "  125.the xxmaj district xxmaj court decided to forward the file to the public prosecutor 's office on the ground that the statements made by xxmaj mr xxmaj mondelli and two other law - enforcement officers ( to the effect that the attack had been necessary to counter the aggression shown by the demonstrators ) did not match the facts . \n",
       "  xxunk 3.30 p.m. , although the demonstrators may still have felt a sense of abuse and injustice , their conduct had no longer been defensive but had been driven by a desire for revenge ; it was therefore unjustified and punishable . \n",
       "  127.the charge ordered by police officer xxmaj lauro , which had triggered the events on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , had been neither unlawful nor arbitrary . xxmaj as a result , the violent reaction by the demonstrators , which had led to the carabinieri being pursued and the jeep being attacked , could not be regarded as a defensive response . \n",
       "  128.the carabinieri in the jeep might well have feared that they would be subjected to an attempted lynching . xxmaj the fact that the demonstrators surrounding them did not have xxmaj molotov cocktails and were therefore not in a position to set the vehicle on fire was a factor that could be appreciated with hindsight . xxmaj the occupants of the jeep could not be blamed for having panicked . \n",
       "  129 . xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had probably been four metres from the jeep when he was shot down . xxup m.p. had stated that he could only see what was happening inside the vehicle . xxmaj when the shot was fired , he had been lying down with his feet pointing towards the rear door of the vehicle . xxmaj he had pulled xxup d.r. down on top of him and could not see his own hand ; he was unable to say whether it had been inside or outside the jeep . xxmaj in any event , he had fired upwards . \n",
       "  130.the xxmaj district xxmaj court judgment mentions the statements made by the expert xxmaj xxunk xxmaj salvi , who performed the autopsy on xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body . xxmaj mr xxmaj salvi stated in particular that the trajectory of the fatal bullet indicated a direct shot and that the metal fragment lodged in the victim 's body had been very difficult to find . xxmaj the fragment , which had shown up on the scan ( see paragraph 60 above ) , “ must have been very small ” ; the experts had tried to locate it by going through the brain tissue section by section ( per xxunk ) , although the latter had been damaged and xxunk with blood . xxmaj the more the experts worked , the more damaged the tissue had become . xxmaj given that the fragment was not a bullet and was of no use for ballistics purposes , the experts had considered it to be a minor detail ( un particolare xxunk ) and had not pursued their search . \n",
       "  2.the appeal judgment \n",
       "  xxunk - four of the accused appealed against the first - instance judgment . xxmaj in a judgment of 9 xxmaj october 2009 , deposited with the registry on 23december 2009 , the xxmaj genoa xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal partly upheld the convictions handed down by the xxmaj district xxmaj court , increased some of the sentences and declared the prosecution of some of the offences time - barred . \n",
       "  xxunk the carabinieri attack on the xxmaj tute xxmaj bianche march , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal largely endorsed the view of the xxmaj district xxmaj court . xxmaj it observed that the carabinieri had encountered the march , which numbered around 10,000 persons , as a result of the route indicated to them by the control room . xxmaj the front of the march , or “ contact group ” , had been made up of around twenty individuals , mostly members of xxmaj parliament , mayors , cultural figures and journalists . xxmaj behind them had been a series of xxmaj xxunk protective devices , joined together ; these were followed by the “ head of the procession ” made up of demonstrators equipped with helmets and shoulder and arm protectors . xxmaj the march had not encountered the scenes of any clashes but had simply proceeded for about two kilometres without meeting any obstacle . xxmaj the protective equipment showed that , although they were not carrying blunt instruments , the demonstrators had been prepared for possible clashes . \n",
       "  xxunk these circumstances it was difficult to understand why officers xxmaj bruno and xxmaj mondelli had decided to launch an attack on the march . xxmaj they had not received any orders to that effect ; on the contrary , they had been requested to avoid crossing the marchers ' path . xxmaj the news that an attack was in progress had been greeted with cries of disapproval in the control room . \n",
       "  134.the carabinieri had been summoned to intervene urgently in xxmaj xxunk xxmaj prison , where law - enforcement officers were struggling to cope with an attack by the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc . xxmaj accordingly , when they encountered the march they had attempted to clear the junction and the tunnel through which they wished to pass . xxmaj according to the witness testimony of one journalist , judged to be “ neutral ” and therefore credible , youths belonging to the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc arriving from the opposite direction to the marchers had thrown stones at the carabinieri ; this had led to the order to fire tear gas , given by xxunk . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded that , although the charge by the carabinieri had been illegitimate , they had been called upon to intervene in a situation characterised by violence from the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc demonstrators , who had earlier ransacked other parts of the city , and by the fact that the junction they needed to cross was occupied by the crowd and the tunnel was blocked by barricades . \n",
       "  135.in the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal 's view , the xxmaj district xxmaj court had correctly found the following actions by the carabinieri to be illegitimate : \n",

       "  xxunk , there had been arbitrary acts in the form of : the use of non - regulation batons ( xxunk ) ( pieces of wood or iron wrapped in adhesive tape and a source of serious cuts and bleeding ) ; the use of armoured vehicles to make “ xxunk ” amidst the demonstrators , pursuing some of them at high speed along the pavement ( the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed that the vehicles did not have sufficiently safe brakes and that one of them had pursued a demonstrator in xxunk fashion , as if attempting to run him over ) ; the infliction of excessive injury and the beating of demonstrators , journalists and an ambulance driver . \n",

       "  138.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal endorsed the xxmaj district xxmaj court 's view that , despite their violent response , the marchers had not been guilty of the offence of criminal damage . xxmaj the damage caused had been minor and had resulted from the use of objects ( cars and refuse containers ) as protection against the carabinieri . xxmaj unlike the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc , the xxmaj tute xxmaj bianche had not taken to the streets with the intention of damaging public or private property symbolising the system they opposed . xxmaj the damage had been confined to the fairly small area in which the response had occurred and , by and large , had ceased with the withdrawal of the carabinieri . xxmaj although “ disquieting ” , the fact that the demonstrators in the front lines had worn protectors could not give rise to the assumption that they had intended to engage in acts of violence . \n",

       "  1.the case originated in an application ( no . xxunk / 03 ) against the xxmaj republic of xxmaj bulgaria lodged with the xxmaj court under xxmaj article 34 of the xxmaj convention for the xxmaj protection of xxmaj human xxmaj rights and xxmaj fundamental xxmaj freedoms ( “ the xxmaj convention ” ) by a xxmaj bulgarian national , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk xxmaj xxunk xxmaj pankov ( “ the applicant ” ) , on 28 xxmaj march 2003 . \n",
       "  2.the applicant was represented by xxmaj mr xxup y. xxmaj grozev , a lawyer practising in xxmaj sofia and by xxmaj mr xxup b. xxmaj boev , formerly a lawyer practising in xxmaj sofia , who on 7october 2008 was granted leave under xxmaj rule 36 4 ( a ) in fine of the xxmaj rules of xxmaj court to continue representing the applicant . xxmaj the xxmaj bulgarian xxmaj government ( “ the xxmaj government ” ) were represented by their xxmaj agents , xxmaj ms xxup n. xxmaj nikolova and xxmaj ms xxup s. xxmaj atanasova , of the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj justice . \n",
       "  3.the applicant alleged that his lifethreatening injury sustained during military shooting practice was due to the use of deadly force by another serviceman , that the authorities failed to take the necessary precautions to prevent that from happening , and that the ensuing investigation was not effective . \n",
       "  4.on 4 xxmaj december 2008 the xxmaj president of the xxmaj fifth xxmaj section decided to give notice of the application to the xxmaj government . xxmaj it was also decided to examine the merits of the application at the same time as its admissibility ( xxmaj article 29 3 of the xxmaj convention ) . \n",

       "  xxup i.the xxup circumstances xxup of xxup the xxup case \n",
       "  5.the applicant was born in 1980 and lives in xxmaj pleven . \n",
       "  a.the incident of 22 xxmaj july 1999 \n",
       "  6.in xxmaj april 1999 the applicant was conscripted into the xxmaj bulgarian xxmaj army to perform his mandatory military service . xxmaj he was serving in a regiment in the town of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj banya . xxmaj in mid - xxmaj july 1999 the regiment doctor relieved him from physical exercise and daily duty because of illness . xxmaj nevertheless , on the night of 21 xxmaj july 1999 he was assigned to night duty . \n",
       "  7.after finishing his duty , in the morning of 22 xxmaj july 1999 the applicant was sent , together with other soldiers from his regiment , to shooting practice at a military shooting range near the town of xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj during the practice soldiers from the applicant 's regiment and another regiment were present on the range . xxmaj the applicant performed his task , which consisted of firing twelve rounds . xxmaj after that he handed back all spent cartridge cases and was sent to a watchtower to guard against outsiders penetrating into the range . xxmaj the tower was a square concrete construction 9.3 metres long and 7metres wide . xxmaj in the middle it had a xxunk chimney . \n",
       "  8.at about 11.10 a.m. , minutes after climbing up the tower , the applicant was shot in the abdomen . xxmaj according to the findings of the ensuing investigation , the shot was fired at close range from his own automatic rifle , whose breechblock he was trying to fix without following the applicable safety procedures . xxmaj the applicant disputes those findings and asserts that the shot was in all probability fired by another soldier from afar . \n",
       "  9.after the shot the applicant fell down on the roof of the tower , screaming and moaning . xxmaj chief xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. , who was sitting with a few soldiers from his regiment at the foot of the tower , rushed up the stairs . xxmaj he brought the applicant down with the help of soldier xxup t. and medical officer xxup n.g. , who were also at the foot of the tower and climbed up after the shot . \n",
       "  10.after that the applicant was put into an ambulance and transported , accompanied by medical officer xxup n.g. , to the xxmaj military xxmaj medical xxmaj academy in xxmaj sofia , where he underwent lifesaving surgical operations on 23 , 26 and 27july 1999 . xxmaj on 28 xxmaj july 1999 his condition was found to be serious but stable . xxmaj he was discharged from hospital on 9 xxmaj september 1999 , and later received a medical discharge from the army . \n",
       "  b.the investigation \n",
       "  11.on the day of the incident a military investigator , notified by the military police , opened a preliminary investigation whose aim was to “ determine the causes and the circumstances in which [ the applicant ] shot himself ” . \n",
       "  12.at 2.30 p.m. the investigator inspected the scene of the incident . xxmaj he found that it had not been preserved intact . xxmaj he described in detail everything he found . xxmaj he also identified , on the basis of the statement of xxmaj chief xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. , the likely positions of the applicant 's body and of his rifle “ after the shot ” . xxmaj he impounded the rifle , a xxunk and xxunk cartridge case , some pieces of dark reddish matter , dactyloscopic traces from the rifle , and traces from the surface of the tower . \n",
       "  13.later that day the hospital where the applicant had been operated upon sent the investigator the piece of skin surrounding his entry wound and acetone smears from his palms . xxmaj the applicant 's commander handed over to the investigator the shirt he had been wearing during the shooting and some of his personal items . \n",
       "  14.the next day , 23 xxmaj july 1999 , the investigator interviewed xxmaj chief xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. , a sergeant responsible for counting the targets at the shooting range , the applicant 's mother , and xxmaj captain xxup y.p. , the officer in charge of the shooting practice . xxmaj he also ordered a complex ballistic , microbiological and physicochemical report and a medical expert report . \n",
       "  xxunk xxmaj lieutenant xxup p.p. said that while he was sitting at the foot of the watchtower he heard a single shot from above , much xxunk than those coming from the firing range , and then heard screaming from the top of the tower . xxmaj he climbed up the stairs and saw the applicant lying on the ground , moaning and xxunk his upper body up and down . xxmaj he noticed that the applicant 's shirt was unbuttoned and that he had a wound on the left side of his abdomen . xxmaj the wound did not have a clear shape and looked more like a star than a hole . xxmaj it was surrounded by a round black patch with a diameter of five to seven centimetres and consisting of many black spots close together . xxmaj the lieutenant saw another wound on the applicant 's back , with a clear round shape , one centimetre in diameter , with a little blood on it . xxmaj he also saw the applicant 's rifle , which did not have a round in its chamber , had its safety lever down and was in xxunk mode . \n",
       "  16.captain xxup y.p. handed over to the investigator the order and the plan for the shooting practice , and described the safety briefing given to all soldiers before the start of the shooting practice . xxmaj he said that after the briefing a chief lieutenant checked the weapons of all soldiers taking part in the practice , and ordered two soldiers to step aside and clean their weapons . xxmaj then the captain announced to the soldiers the manner in which the practice would be conducted and the safety measures . xxmaj they were to fire solely upon his command , and stop firing immediately if he so ordered , or if they received a visual signal from the watchtower , or if they noticed people , animals or machines near the targets . xxmaj the firing range was delimited by xxunk at both ends . xxmaj it was strictly forbidden , under any circumstances , to point a firearm outside the firing range . xxmaj if a firearm jammed , the soldier had to report it immediately , remain still , put the safety catch down and not touch the firearm . xxmaj the soldiers fired in groups of four , with those waiting their turn having unloaded weapons . xxmaj the soldiers first went to the starting point , received magazines containing twelve rounds , and put them in their bags , while keeping their rifles on their backs . xxmaj when they received the order to fire , they had to run to the firing position with their rifles pointing towards the firing range . xxmaj then , on a further order , they had to take the magazines out of the bags , put them onto the rifles , load a round , lift the safety catch and report that they were ready to fire . xxmaj when ordered to fire , after the captain had made sure that each of them had loaded his weapon and was ready to fire , they put the safety catch in automatic firing mode and started firing . xxmaj after finishing firing , they had to report , remove the magazine , and , when ordered , fire a control shot towards the firing range and put the safety catch on . xxmaj after that they had to stand up , have their rifles checked by the captain with the magazine removed , fire a second control shot , and hand back the spent cartridges . xxmaj at the time of the incident a group of soldiers was firing , with the captain standing about two metres behind them . xxmaj immediately after hearing the applicant 's screams the captain ordered the soldiers to stop firing and empty their weapons , and then checked the weapons . \n",
       "  17.the order for the shooting practice , issued by the head of the regiment , designed a commanding officer , an officer , a sergeant and a soldier ensuring the sealing off of the area , a technician , an emergency medical officer , a standby ambulance , two guards , one of whom was the applicant , and a head of the ammunition supply point . xxmaj it directed the commanding officer to ensure compliance with the safety measures in line with the applicable instructions . xxmaj an annex to that order shows that all the soldiers confirmed that they had been briefed about the safety measures . \n",
       "  18.on 27 xxmaj july 1999 the investigator interviewed medical officer xxup n.g. , sergeantmajor xxup g.i. , the person in charge of ammunition safety during the shooting practice , and soldier xxup r.v. of the applicant 's regiment . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk said that , while sitting at the foot of the watchtower , she heard a loud whizzing sound and then screaming . xxmaj she climbed up the tower and saw a wound on the applicant 's abdomen . xxmaj it was a small hole with a round xxunk patch around it . xxmaj later , the officer was with the applicant in the ambulance , she noticed another wound , with a diameter of one centimetre , on the left side of his lower back . xxmaj in the ambulance , she repeatedly asked the applicant how he had sustained the injury , but he kept silent . xxmaj at one point , he said “ i wanted to fix it ” . xxmaj she pressed him for more , but he said “ xxmaj oh , leave me , leave me ” and asked whether they had already reached the hospital . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk said that following the incident , when he had been counting the cartridge cases spent during the shooting practice , somebody , probably xxmaj lieutenant xxup m. , threw a cartridge case on to the pile , and it got mixed up with the others . xxmaj when xxup g.i. enquired about the case 's origin , lieutenant xxup m. had replied that it had come from the scene of the incident . xxmaj later , with a view to identifying the case , the officer in charge of the practice ordered xxup g.i. to divide the cases up into lots . xxmaj he found only one with a diverging serial number , and handed it over to the investigator . xxup g.i. also said that he was certain that the applicant had earlier returned to him all twelve cases of the cartridges allotted to him for the shooting practice . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk said that the applicant had been in a good mood on the day of the incident , that both of them had had their rifles checked and returned their spent cartridge cases after the shooting practice , and that , prior to climbing up the watchtower , the applicant did not have a magazine on his rifle . \n",
       "  22.on 29 xxmaj july 1999 the investigator interviewed the applicant , who was still in the intensive care unit of the emergency surgical department of the xxmaj military xxmaj medical xxmaj academy in xxmaj sofia ( see paragraph 10 above ) . xxmaj according to the record of this interview , the applicant said that while he was on the watchtower he tried to fix his rifle 's sling . xxmaj he knelt down on his right knee and laid the rifle on the ground with the muzzle pointing towards him . xxmaj he noticed that the safety catch was in automatic firing position and the breechblock was not in position . xxmaj with his right hand he pushed the breechblock forward . xxmaj it jammed and he used force to push it , with the rifle 's barrel lying on his left hand and the magazine holder pointing upwards . xxmaj when the breechblock moved into position , he heard a shot . xxmaj he became short of breath and started crying for help . \n",
       "  23.the applicant strongly disputes the accuracy of this record and maintains that , being in a very serious medical condition , he could not remember how this interview unfolded or the statements he made during it . xxmaj he submits that the only reliable statements were those which he made during a subsequent interview on 13 xxmaj september 1999 , four days after his discharge from hospital . xxmaj at that interview he said that before going to the tower he fired all twelve cartridges at the shooting range and then returned the spent cases to sergeantmajor xxup g.i. xxmaj when going up the tower , he noticed two sergeants there , talked to them for a while and then remained alone . xxmaj when standing with his left side toward the shooting range and his rifle slung over his shoulder , he suddenly felt powerless , weak in the knees and short of breath , but did not hear a shot close by . xxmaj he started shouting for help and ten seconds later someone came up to him . \n",
       "  24.on 11 and 17 xxmaj november 1999 the investigator interviewed xxmaj captain xxup v.p. , a staff doctor from the applicant 's regiment , and two soldiers serving with the applicant . xxmaj all of them said that they had not seen any signs of depression in the applicant prior to the incident . \n",
       "  25.the medical expert report ordered by the investigator was drawn up on 28 xxmaj july 1999 by xxmaj dr xxup g.d. , deputy chief of the xxmaj forensic xxmaj medicine xxmaj centre of the xxmaj bulgarian xxmaj army . xxmaj he had not examined the applicant but based his report on the existing medical documentation . xxmaj the report read as follows : \n",
       "  “ ... xxmaj the entry wound is situated on the front left side of the abdomen , slightly above the navel and on the midclavicular line , with burns on the surrounding skin . xxmaj the exit wound is on the left side of the back , under the corner of the scapula . \n",
       "  xxmaj if the body was in an upright position the channel of the wound would go slightly upward from the front to the back . \n",
       "  xxmaj the entry wound 's description in the medical documents shows that it was the result of a shot from a very close range . xxmaj to determine precisely the distance of the shot it is necessary to carry out a ballistic testing of the clothes worn by [ the applicant ] at the time when the shot was fired . \n",
       "  xxmaj when passing through the body the projectile ( the bullet ) , in addition to damaging the soft tissues , broke the twelfth rib on the left , ruptured the front and the back walls of the stomach , the xxunk colon , the splenic flexure ( in two places ) , and the spleen . xxmaj as a result , there was a flow of faeces and a massive haemorrhage in the abdominal cavity , causing a temporarily lifethreatening medical condition . \n",
       "  xxmaj the above necessitated an emergency lifesaving surgery , consisting of a full midline laparotomy , with a drainage of the blood and the faeces from the abdominal cavity and a resection of the xxunk , a xxunk - shaped resection and stitching of the stomach , partial resection of the transversal colon and of the splenic flexure , with a removal of a xxunk xxunk , surgical removal of the spleen , treatment of the fractured rib , lavage and drainage of the abdominal cavity , and laparostoma . \n",
       "  xxmaj after that surgical intervention the bleeding was stopped and the risk to [ the applicant 's ] life was averted , i.e. the case concerns loss of the spleen . \n",
       "  xxmaj it should be borne in mind that without a timely and xxunk medical intervention death would have occurred very rapidly . \n",
       "  xxmaj after the surgical intervention [ the applicant ] was placed in an intensive care unit . xxmaj following xxmaj xray data about a haemorrhage in the left pleural cavity on 23 xxmaj july 1999 , a left - side xxunk ( drainage of the pleural fluid ) was carried out . xxmaj on 26 xxmaj july 1999 a surgical bandage was made , and on 27 xxmaj july 1999 – a second laparotomy with a revision of the laparostoma and of the abdominal cavity was carried out , a local aesthetic was applied on the mesentery , xxunk and xxunk of the small intestine through it were performed , and a new laparostoma was placed . xxmaj after the surgical intervention the [ applicant ] was again placed in an intensive care unit . xxmaj on 28july 1999 his condition was assessed as being stable but serious . ” \n",
       "  26.on 10 xxmaj september 1999 a biology expert drew up a report saying that the blood - red dry matter taken from the scene of the incident was indeed human blood . xxmaj however , as a result of the depletion of the sample , it was impossible to determine its type or to tell whether it was identical with the applicant 's blood . xxmaj the applicant 's shirt had blood on it . \n",
       "  27.in a report of 14 xxmaj september 1999 three experts stated that the applicant 's rifle was in good working order and able to produce a shot . xxmaj the force needed to be applied to the trigger in order to fire was within the acceptable limits . xxmaj they further found that the rifle had been fired since it had last been cleaned , and that the cartridge case handed over by sergeantmajor xxup g.i. to the investigator did not come from that rifle . \n",
       "  28.in a physicochemical report of 4 xxmaj october 1999 two experts said that they had been unable to conclude whether the gunpowder from the rifle 's barrel was identical to that taken from the applicant 's shirt . xxmaj they also said that the smears from the applicant 's palms and wrist - bands did not contain traces of a shot . \n",
       "  c.the discontinuance of the investigation and the applicant 's appeals \n",
       "  29.on 22 xxmaj november 1999 the investigator proposed discontinuing the investigation . xxmaj he found that the applicant had shot himself at close range . xxmaj there was no evidence pointing to breaches of the regulations on conducting shooting exercises or the applicable safety rules . xxmaj nor was there any indication that the applicant had had psychological problems or depression which could push him to commit suicide , or that he had tried to damage his health with a view to evading military service . xxmaj the evidence thus led to the conclusion that his injury was the result of an accidental shot fired because of his improper handling of his firearm . \n",
       "  30.on 30 xxmaj november 1999 the xxmaj sofia xxmaj military xxmaj regional xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office decided to discontinue the investigation , repeating the reasons given by the investigator verbatim . \n",
       "  31.on 9 xxmaj april 2001 the applicant appealed to the xxmaj military xxmaj appellate xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office . xxmaj he argued , among other things , that the authorities had explored solely the version that he had shot himself . xxmaj no expert report had been drawn up on the identity of the firearm which had produced the shot . xxmaj it was absurd to think that this was the rifle he had been carrying while on the watchtower , because it had not been loaded and had its safety catch down . xxmaj his clothes had not been examined by an expert and it was therefore impossible to conclude whether or nor the shot had been fired at close range . xxmaj the medical expert report was not based on primary medical documents and had thus come to the erroneous conclusion that the bullet had left his body , producing a second wound on his back . xxmaj there were indications , such as the noise of the shot , noted by the witnesses , that he had been wounded by a xxunk and that the bullet had shattered . \n",
       "  32.on 18 xxmaj june 2002 the xxmaj military xxmaj appellate xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office dismissed the appeal . xxmaj it noted that during his interview on 29 xxmaj july 1999 the applicant had stated that he had shot himself . xxmaj moreover , the medical expert had found that he had both an entry and an exit wound . xxmaj the medical documents showed that the wound was from a shot fired at close range . xxmaj xxunk else was around the applicant at the time of the shot . xxmaj the lower prosecutor 's findings were thus correct . \n",
       "  33.on 9 xxmaj july 2002 the applicant appealed to the xxmaj chief xxmaj prosecutor . xxmaj he asserted that his statement of 29 xxmaj july 1999 was far from reliable . xxmaj at that time he had been in hospital , in a very bad condition following several lifesaving operations . xxmaj it was therefore surprising to see that the official record of this statement seemed so detailed and logical . xxmaj no expert report had been drawn up on the identity of the firearm which had produced the shot , whereas the evidence showing that it had been fired by his rifle was unreliable and was called into doubt by other evidence . xxmaj there was no evidence showing that the shot had been fired at close range . xxmaj lastly , no consideration had been given to the fact that he had been ordered to take part in the shooting exercises after night duty and while he was ill . \n",
       "  34.on 11 xxmaj october 2002 the xxmaj supreme xxmaj cassation xxmaj prosecutor 's xxmaj office dismissed the appeal . xxmaj it observed that the testing of the piece of skin surrounding the applicant 's entry wound showed that the shot had been fired at close range . xxmaj this was consistent with the applicant 's statement of 29 xxmaj july 1999 and the statement of medical officer xxup n.g. xxmaj it was impossible to examine the bullet , because it had not been found . xxmaj it was established that the spent cartridge case handed over to the investigator by sergeantmajor xxup g.i. did not come from the applicant 's rifle . xxmaj however , it could not be ruled out that xxup g.i. had mistakenly identified it as the one thrown on to the pile by lieutenant xxup m. , given that the pile contained in total more than nine hundred spent cartridge cases . xxmaj even if all of them were to be tested , which was impossible in view of the time elapsed since the events , that would not have led to a definite conclusion about the firearm 's identity . xxmaj the lower prosecutors had thus correctly found that the applicant had injured himself by handling his rifle improperly . xxmaj there was no indication that other soldiers had shot him or that he had injured himself deliberately . \n",
       "  d.the private expert opinion obtained by the applicant in xxmaj june 2003 \n",
       "  35.on 11 xxmaj june 2003 the applicant 's representative before the xxmaj court wrote to xxmaj dr xxup p.l. , the head of the forensic department of the xxmaj pleven xxmaj medical xxmaj university . xxmaj he sent him the relevant medical documents and asked for his opinion on ( a ) whether the description of the applicant 's wound was comprehensive ; ( b ) whether it was possible to determine , on the basis of that description , the distance from which the shot had been fired ; ( c ) what could be the exact basis for such determination ; ( d ) what could be the possibility for error ; and ( e ) what type of data would allow a more precise determination of the distance from which the shot had been fired . \n",
       "  36.dr xxup p.l. 's opinion , drawn up on 13 xxmaj june 2003 , read as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the questions you pose in your letter ... may be answered like this : \n",
       "  1.the description , which says ' visible entry wound in the abdominal area , at the midclavicular line , slightly above the navel , with burns ' , is not detailed – the shape of the wound , the condition of the edges , the size of the wound ( diameter or xxunk ) , the size of the ' burn ' and its position relative to the edges of the wound – xxunk or eccentric – are lacking . \n",
       "  2.on the basis of that description , one could make the very general conclusion that the wound was the result of a shot from a close distance . xxmaj indeed , the shot could have been even a contact one , if it was fired through several layers of clothing , or thicker , or damp clothing . \n",
       "  xxmaj in forensic medicine , shot distances are categorised in three ways : contact shots ( complete or incomplete ) , closedistance shots ( within the range of action of the shot 's additional effects ) , and xxunk shots ( outside the range of action of the shot 's additional effects ) , without this being linked with a concrete distance in centimetres or meters . \n",
       "  3.the basis for the conclusion in point 2 is the fact that the wound was surrounded by a ring , described as a ' burn ' . \n",
       "  4.in the case of closedistance shots ( and sometimes in the case of contact shots ) , one can see traces of unburned powder , metal particles , xxunk , etc . around the wound ( the socalled ' stain ring ' or ' blackened ring ' ) . xxmaj the range at which those can make an impact ( in the case of a shot with a xxmaj kalashnikov rifle ) is twentyfive to thirty centimetres . xxmaj with the increase in the distance , the intensity of those additional effects of the shot diminishes . \n",
       "  xxmaj there is no burning around an entry firearm wound because the action of the flame and the hot gases is short - term . xxmaj sometimes one can find traces of the high xxunk slight burning of thin or more tender hairs or of artificial tissues . \n",
       "  xxmaj the ' stain ring ' around the wound is a result of the mechanical action of the blacks and of the other particles and their ramming into the skin , as well as of the chemical action of the powder gases and the other residues from the shot . \n",
       "  xxmaj it is also possible that the so - called ' burn ' was in fact a ' muzzle mark ' – a bruise around the entry wound resulting from the impact of the muzzle in the case of a full contact shot . xxmaj such marks are characteristic for shots in the head or in areas having a solid surface ( bone ) underneath , but can sometimes occur in cases of shots in the abdominal area . xxmaj the available description does not allow a more specific conclusion to be drawn . \n",
       "  xxmaj the possibility for error when concluding that a shot has been fired from a close distance on the basis of a ' stain ring ' is minimal . xxmaj the medical literature refers to the so - called ' phenomenon of xxmaj vinogradov ' , in which such a ring appears after a shot from a distance of even several hundred meters . xxmaj however , such occurrences are rare and do not correspond to the description of the wound in the present case . xxmaj the description of the wound allows one to conclude that the shot was fired either from a close distance or that it was a contact shot . a long - distance shot is to be excluded . \n",
       "  5.it would be possible to make a more specific assessment of the distance from which the shot has been fired on the basis of : \n",
       "  –a more detailed medical description ( as mentioned in point 1 ) ; \n",
       "  xxunk information about the conditions in which the shot was fired ( clothes , type of bullet , etc . ) ; \n",
       "  –a special analysis determining the composition of the stain around the wound or on the clothes ; \n",
       "  xxunk shots with the same weapon and in the same conditions as the shot under consideration . ” \n",
       "  xxup ii.relevant xxup domestic xxup law \n",
       "  37.article 192 of the 1974 xxmaj code of xxmaj criminal xxmaj procedure , as in force at the material time , provided that proceedings concerning publicly prosecutable offences could be initiated only by a prosecutor or an investigator . xxmaj when military courts had jurisdiction to hear a case , as for example when it concerned soldiers or army officers ( xxmaj article 388 1(1 ) of the xxmaj code ) , the responsibility for conducting the preliminary investigation lay with military investigators and prosecutors . \n",
       "  38.under xxmaj article 237 1 ( 1 ) of the xxmaj code , as in force at the relevant time , prosecutors were to discontinue an investigation if they found that the matters alleged did not amount to a criminal offence . xxmaj until 31 xxmaj december 1999 their decisions to do so could be appealed against before the superior prosecutor ( paragraph 6 of that xxmaj article , as in force until 31 xxmaj december 1999 ) . \n",

       "  51.after leaving xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda the three carabinieri who had been in the jeep went to the casualty department of xxmaj genoa xxmaj hospital . xxup m.p. complained of diffuse bruising to his right leg and an injury to the skull with open wounds ; against the advice of the doctors , who wished to admit him , xxup m.p. signed a discharge and left the hospital at around 9.30 p.m. xxmaj he had an injury to the skull which , he said , had been caused by a blow to the head with a blunt instrument while he had been in the jeep . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk presented with bruising and abrasions to the nose and the right cheekbone and bruises on the left shoulder and left foot . xxup f.c. was suffering from a posttraumatic psychological disorder and was expected to recover within fifteen days . \n",
       "  53.medical examinations were carried out to establish the nature of the injuries and their connection with the attack on the jeep 's occupants . xxmaj the reports concluded that the injuries sustained by xxup m.p. and xxup d.r. had not been life - threatening . xxup m.p. 's head injuries could have been caused by a stone thrown at him , but it was not possible to determine the origin of his other injuries . xxmaj the injury to xxup d.r. 's face could have been caused by a stone thrown at him and his shoulder injury by a blow from a wooden plank . \n",
       "  ( c)the ballistics tests ordered by the public prosecutor 's office \n",
       "  ( i)the first set of tests \n",
       "  54.on 4 xxmaj september 2001 the public prosecutor 's office instructed xxunk to establish whether the two spent cartridges found at the scene ( one in the jeep and the other a few metres from xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body – see paragraph 31 above ) had come from the same weapon , and specifically from xxup m.p. 's weapon . xxmaj in his report of 5 xxmaj december 2001 the expert concluded that there was a 90 % probability that the cartridge found in the jeep had come from xxup m.p. 's pistol , whereas there was only a 10 % probability that the cartridge found close to xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body had issued from the same weapon . xxmaj in accordance with xxmaj article 392 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj criminal xxmaj procedure ( “ the xxup ccp ” ) , these tests were carried out unilaterally , that is to say , without the injured party having an opportunity to participate . \n",
       "  ( ii)the second set of tests \n",
       "  55.the public prosecutor 's office appointed a second expert , police inspector xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj the latter , in a report submitted on 15 xxmaj january 2002 , stated that there was a 60 % probability that the spent cartridge found near the victim 's body had come from xxup m.p. 's weapon . xxmaj he concluded that both the cartridges had come from xxup m.p. 's pistol , and estimated the distance between xxup m.p. and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani at the moment of impact at between 110 and 140 centimetres . xxmaj the tests were conducted unilaterally . \n",
       "  ( iii)the third set of tests \n",
       "  56.on 12 xxmaj february 2002 the public prosecutor 's office instructed a panel of experts ( made up of xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj mr xxmaj benedetti , xxmaj mr xxmaj romanini and xxmaj mr xxmaj torre ) “ to reconstruct , even in virtual form , the actions of xxup m.p. and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani in the moments immediately before and after the bullet struck the victim 's body ” . xxmaj in particular , the experts were asked to “ establish the distance between xxup m.p. and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani , their respective angles of vision and xxup m.p. 's field of vision inside the jeep at the moment the shots were fired ” . xxmaj it appears from the file that xxmaj mr xxmaj romanini had published an article in xxmaj september 2001 in a specialist journal ( xxup xxunk xxmaj xxunk ) , in which he expressed the view , among other things , that xxup m.p. 's actions had constituted “ a clear and wholly justified defensive reaction ” . \n",
       "  57.the representatives and experts appointed by the applicants attended the examinations by the panel of experts . xxmaj the applicants ' lawyer , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk , stated that he did not wish to make an application for the immediate production of evidence ( incidente xxunk ) . xxmaj article 392 1 ( f ) and 2 of the xxup ccp allows the public prosecutor and the accused , among other things , to request the investigating judge ( giudice per le indagini preliminari ) to order a forensic examination where the latter concerns a person , object or place which is subject to unavoidable alteration or where , if ordered during the trial , the examination in question could entail suspension of the proceedings for a period exceeding sixty days . xxmaj under xxmaj article 394 of the xxup ccp the injured party may request the public prosecutor to apply for the immediate production of evidence . xxmaj if the public prosecutor refuses the request , he or she must issue an order giving reasons and must serve it on the injured party . \n",
       "  58.an on - site inspection was conducted on 20 xxmaj april 2002 . xxmaj traces of the impact of a shot were found on the wall of a building on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , at a height of about five metres . \n",
       "  59.on 10 xxmaj june 2002 the experts submitted their report . xxmaj the experts stated at the outset that the fact that they had not had access to xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body ( because it had been cremated ) had been a major obstacle which had prevented them from producing an exhaustive report , as they had been unable to re - examine parts of the body and search for micro - traces . xxmaj on the basis of the “ little material available ” the experts attempted to establish first of all what the impact of the bullet had been on xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body , setting out the following considerations . \n",
       "  60.the injuries to the skull had been very serious and had resulted in death “ within a short space of time ” . xxmaj the bullet had not exited whole from xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's head ; the report ( xxunk xxunk ) of the full body scan performed before the autopsy referred to a “ subcutaneous fragment , probably metal ” above the bones in the occipital region . xxmaj this piece of opaque metal looked like a fragment of bullet casing . xxmaj the appearance of the entry wound on the face did not lend itself to an unequivocal interpretation ; its irregular shape was explained chiefly by the type of tissue in the part of the body struck by the bullet . xxmaj however , one possible explanation was that the bullet had not hit xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani directly , but had encountered an intermediate object which could have distorted it and slowed it down before it reached the victim 's body . xxmaj that hypothesis would explain the small dimensions of the exit wound and the fact that the bullet had fragmented inside xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's head . \n",
       "  61.the experts reported finding a small fragment of lead , probably from the bullet , which had come off xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's balaclava when the latter was being handled ; it was impossible to ascertain whether the fragment had come from the front , side or back of the balaclava . xxmaj it bore traces of a substance which was not part of the bullet as such , but came from material used in the building industry . xxmaj in addition , micro - fragments of lead were found on the front and back of the balaclava , apparently confirming the hypothesis that the bullet had lost part of its casing at the moment of impact . xxmaj according to the experts , it was not possible to establish the nature of the “ intermediate object ” apparently hit by the bullet ; however , they ruled out the possibility that it was the fire extinguisher which xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been holding in his outstretched hand . xxmaj the distance from which the shot had been fired had been in excess of 50 - 100 centimetres . \n",
       "  62.in order to reconstruct the events on the basis of the “ intermediate object theory ” , the experts then had some test shots fired and conducted video and computer simulations . xxmaj they concluded that it was not possible to establish the bullet 's trajectory as the latter had undoubtedly been altered as a result of the collision . xxmaj on the basis of video footage showing a stone disintegrating in the air and of the shot that could be heard on the soundtrack , the experts concluded that the stone had shattered immediately after the shot had been fired . a computer simulation showed the bullet , fired upwards , hitting xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani after colliding with the stone in question , thrown at the jeep by another demonstrator . xxmaj the experts estimated that the distance between xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani and the jeep had been approximately 1.75metres and that xxup m.p. had been able to see xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani at the moment the shot was fired . \n",
       "  6.the applicants ' investigations \n",
       "  63.the applicants submitted a statement made to their lawyer by xxup j.m. , one of the demonstrators , on 19 xxmaj february 2002 . xxup j.m. stated in particular that xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had still been alive after the jeep had driven over his body . xxmaj the applicants also produced a statement made by a carabiniere ( xxup v.m. ) , who reported a widespread practice among law - enforcement officers consisting in altering bullets of the kind used by xxup m.p. in order to increase their capacity to expand and hence fragment . \n",
       "  64.lastly , the applicants submitted two reports drawn up by experts they themselves had chosen . xxmaj according to one of the experts , xxmaj mr xxmaj gentile , the bullet had already been in fragments when it struck the victim . xxmaj the fact that it had fragmented could be explained by a manufacturing defect or by its having been manipulated to make it more likely to break up . xxmaj in the expert 's view , however , these two scenarios occurred only rarely and were therefore less likely than the one advanced by the prosecuting authorities ' experts ( namely that the bullet had collided with an intermediate object ) . \n",
       "  65.the other experts appointed by the applicants to reconstruct the events concluded that the stone had shattered on impact with the jeep rather than with the bullet fired by xxup m.p .. xxmaj in order to reconstruct the events on the basis of the audiovisual material , and especially of the photographs , it was necessary to establish the exact position of the photographer , and in particular his or her angle of vision , taking into account also the type of equipment used . xxmaj in addition , it was necessary to establish the timing of the images and how they fitted in with the sound . xxmaj the applicants ' experts criticised the method used by the prosecuting authorities ' experts , who had based their analysis on “ video and computer simulations ” and had not analysed the available images rigorously and in detail . xxmaj the method used to perform the test shots was also criticised . \n",
       "  66.the applicants ' experts concluded that xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been about three metres away from the jeep when the shot was fired . xxmaj while it was undeniable that the fatal bullet had been in fragments when it struck the victim , the possibility of its having collided with the stone which could be seen in the video should be ruled out . a stone would have distorted the bullet differently and left different marks on xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body . xxmaj moreover , xxup m.p. had not fired upwards . \n",
       "  d.the request to discontinue the proceedings and the applicants ' objection \n",
       "  1.the request to discontinue the proceedings \n",
       "  67.on completion of the domestic investigation the xxmaj genoa public prosecutor decided to request that the case against xxup m.p. and xxup f.c. be discontinued . xxmaj the public prosecutor noted first of all that far - reaching changes had been made to the organisation of the public - order operations on the night of 19 xxmaj july 2001 , and took the view that this partly explained the problems that had arisen on 20 xxmaj july . xxmaj however , he did not detail the changes or the problems that had resulted . \n",
       "  68.the public prosecutor went on to observe that xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro 's version of events and that of xxmaj captain xxmaj cappello differed on one specific point : whereas the former asserted that the decision to position law - enforcement personnel on xxmaj via xxmaj caffa in order to block the demonstrators had been taken by mutual agreement , the latter maintained that it had been a unilateral decision taken by xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro despite the risks entailed by the small size of the detachment and the fact that the men were tired . \n",
       "  69.the experts agreed on the following points : two shots had been fired from xxup m.p. 's pistol , the first of which had killed xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ; the bullet in question had not fragmented solely as a result of striking the victim ; and the photograph of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani holding the fire extinguisher had been taken when he was approximately three metres away from the jeep . \n",
       "  70.however , they differed on the following points : \n",
       "  ( a)according to the prosecuting authorities ' experts , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been 1.75 metres from the jeep when the bullet struck him ( approximately three metres away according to the xxmaj giuliani family 's experts ) ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk to the xxmaj giuliani family 's experts , the shot had been fired before the stone could be seen on the video , contrary to the view of the prosecuting authorities ' experts . \n",
       "  71.as the parties agreed that the bullet had fragmented before striking the victim , the public prosecutor concluded that they were also in agreement as to the causes of the bullet 's fragmentation , and that the applicants subscribed to the “ intermediate object theory ” . xxmaj other possible explanations for the fragmentation of the bullet advanced by the applicants – such as the manipulation of the bullet or a manufacturing defect – had been considered by the applicants themselves to be much less likely . xxmaj they could not therefore be regarded as valid explanations in the public prosecutor 's view . \n",
       "  72.the investigation had been lengthy , in particular owing to delays with some of the forensic reports , the “ superficial nature ” of the autopsy report and the errors committed by one of the experts , xxmaj mr xxmaj xxunk . xxmaj however , it had addressed all the relevant issues in detail and led to the conclusion that the hypothesis of the bullet having been fired upwards and deflected by a stone was “ the most convincing ” . xxmaj nevertheless , there was insufficient evidence in the file to determine whether xxup m.p. had fired with the sole intention of dispersing the demonstrators or had knowingly run the risk of injuring or killing one or more of them . xxmaj there were three possibilities , and “ the matter [ would ] never be resolved with certainty ” . xxmaj the possibilities were as follows : \n",
       "  –the shots had been designed to intimidate the demonstrators and it was therefore a case of causing death by negligence ; \n",
       "  xxup –m.p. had fired the shots in order to put a stop to the attack and had accepted the risk of killing someone ; that would mean that it was a case of intentional homicide ; \n",
       "  xxup –m.p. had aimed at xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ; this would also be intentional homicide . \n",
       "  xxmaj in the public prosecutor 's view , the evidence in the file was such that the third possibility could be ruled out . \n",
       "  73.the public prosecutor further considered that the fact that the bullet had collided with the stone was not capable of severing the causal link between xxup m.p. 's actions and xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death . xxmaj given that the link remained , the question was whether xxup m.p. had acted in self - defence . \n",
       "  74 . xxmaj it had been proven that the physical integrity of the jeep 's occupants had been under threat and that xxup m.p. had been “ responding ” in the face of danger . xxmaj that response had to be examined in terms of both its necessity and its proportionality , “ the latter aspect being the more delicate ” . \n",
       "  75.the public prosecutor took the view that xxup m.p. had had no other option and could not have been expected to act differently , since “ the jeep was surrounded by demonstrators [ and ] the physical aggression against the occupants was patent and virulent ” . xxup m.p. had been justified in perceiving his life to be in danger . xxmaj the pistol had been a tool capable of putting a stop to the attack , and xxup m.p. could not be criticised for the equipment issued to him . xxmaj he could not be expected to refrain from using his weapon and submit to an attack liable to endanger his physical integrity . xxmaj these considerations justified a decision to discontinue the case . \n",
       "  2.the applicants ' objection \n",
       "  76.on 10 xxmaj december 2002 the applicants lodged an objection against the public prosecutor 's request to discontinue the proceedings . xxmaj they alleged that , since the prosecuting authorities themselves had acknowledged that the investigation had been flawed and raised questions which had not been answered with certainty , adversarial proceedings were essential in order to arrive at the truth . xxmaj in their view , it was impossible to argue simultaneously that xxup m.p. had fired into the air and that he had acted in self - defence , particularly since he had said that he could not see xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani when he had fired the shots . \n",
       "  77.the applicants further remarked that the intermediate object theory , which they disputed , had been put forward one year after the events and was based on pure supposition not backed up by objective evidence . xxmaj there were other possible explanations . \n",
       "  78.the applicants also observed that , according to the evidence in the file , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had still been alive after the jeep had driven over his body . xxmaj they stressed that the autopsy report , which found that no appreciable injuries had been caused by the jeep driving over the body , had been described by the public prosecutor as superficial ; they also criticised the decision to entrust a number of investigative measures to the carabinieri . \n",
       "  79.it followed that xxup m.p. and xxup f.c. should have been committed for trial . xxmaj in the alternative , the applicants requested that further investigative measures be undertaken , in particular : \n",
       "  ( a)that a forensic report be prepared aimed at establishing the causes and the time of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death , in order to ascertain in particular whether he had still been alive when the jeep drove over his body , and afterwards ; \n",
       "  ( b)that evidence be heard from the chief of police , xxmaj mr xxmaj de xxmaj gennaro , and from carabiniere xxmaj zappia , to establish what instructions had been given regarding the wearing of weapons on the thigh ; \n",
       "  ( c)that the person who had thrown the stone which allegedly deflected the bullet be identified and traced ; \n",
       "  ( d)that further evidence be heard from the demonstrators who had come forward ; \n",
       "  ( e)that evidence be heard from the carabiniere xxup v.m. , who had reported the practice of cutting the tips of bullets ( see paragraph 63 above ) ; \n",
       "  ( f)that forensic tests be carried out on the spent cartridges and on the weapons of all the police and carabinieri on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda at the time of the events . \n",
       "  3.the hearing before the investigating judge \n",
       "  80.the hearing before the investigating judge took place on 17 xxmaj april 2003 . xxmaj the applicants maintained their argument that the fatal bullet had not been deflected but had struck the victim directly . xxmaj however , they conceded that there was no evidence that xxup m.p. had altered the bullet to increase its impact ; that was simply one theory . \n",
       "  81.the representative of the public prosecutor 's office said he had the impression that “ certain points which [ he had ] believed to be the subject of agreement were in fact not ; on the contrary , there were divergences of opinion ” . xxmaj he pointed out that the applicants ' expert , xxmaj mr xxmaj gentile , had been in agreement as to the fact that the bullet had been damaged before striking xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj furthermore , xxmaj mr xxmaj gentile had acknowledged that one of the possible causes of the damage was a collision with some object or an intrinsic defect in the bullet , and that the second cause was less likely than the first . \n",
       "  e.the decision of the investigating judge \n",
       "  82.by an order lodged with the registry on 5 xxmaj may 2003 , the xxmaj genoa investigating judge granted the public prosecutor 's request to discontinue the case . \n",
       "  1.establishment of the facts \n",
       "  83.the investigating judge referred to an anonymous account of the events posted by a xxmaj french person on an anarchist website ( xxunk ) , which she considered to be credible given that it concurred with the audiovisual material and with the witness statements . xxmaj the account in question described the situation on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda and a charge by demonstrators against the carabinieri . xxmaj the charge had been led by demonstrators throwing anything that came to hand , followed by others carrying containers and rubbish bins for use as mobile barricades . xxmaj the atmosphere on the square was described as “ xxunk ” , with the lawenforcement agencies coming under attack from a crowd which was advancing , throwing missiles and immediately picking up new ones . xxmaj the carabinieri , for their part , were firing tear gas , but a contingent was eventually forced to retreat towards xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , where one of the two jeeps accompanying them found itself xxunk in and surrounded by demonstrators . xxmaj the latter , brandishing iron bars and other objects , began hitting the jeep , and the rear window was soon smashed . xxmaj the author of the account heard two shots and could see the hand of one of the two carabinieri inside the jeep , holding a firearm . xxmaj when the jeep drove off and the noise died down , he saw a young man with serious head injuries lying on the ground . xxmaj the author also described the anger of certain demonstrators on learning that a demonstrator had died . \n",
       "  84.the investigating judge observed that the description by the anonymous demonstrator tallied with the findings of the investigation , according to which , at around 5 p.m. , a group of demonstrators had gathered in xxmaj via xxmaj caffa at the junction with xxmaj via xxmaj tolemaide , erecting barricades using rubbish bins , supermarket trolleys and other objects . xxmaj from behind this barricade the group began throwing large numbers of stones and hard objects at a contingent of carabinieri who , having been stationed originally on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda at the corner of xxmaj via xxmaj caffa , had begun to move forward in a bid to stop the demonstrators , whose numbers had increased in the meantime . xxmaj two jeeps , one of them driven by xxup f.c. and with xxup m.p. and xxup d.r. on board , joined the contingent of carabinieri ; however , the demonstrators charged violently , forcing the contingent to retreat . xxmaj the jeeps reversed towards xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , where one of them collided with a refuse container . xxmaj in a matter of moments , the demonstrators surrounded the vehicle , hitting it using all available means and throwing stones . xxmaj as the audiovisual material in the file showed , the jeep 's windows were smashed with stones , iron bars and sticks . xxmaj the unrelenting nature of the demonstrators ' attack on the jeep was described as “ impressive ” . xxmaj some stones struck members of the carabinieri in the face and the head and one demonstrator , xxmaj mr xxmaj monai , thrust a long wooden beam through one of the windows , with the result that xxup d.r. sustained bruises and grazing to his right shoulder . \n",
       "  xxunk of the photographs showed xxup m.p. kicking a fire extinguisher away ; this was very probably the metal object which had caused severe bruising to his leg . xxmaj successive photographs showed a hand holding a weapon above the jeep 's spare wheel while a young man ( xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ) reached down to the ground and picked up a fire extinguisher , in all likelihood with the intention of throwing it at the jeep 's rear window . xxmaj at that moment two shots were fired from inside the jeep and the young man fell to the ground . xxmaj the jeep drove over his body twice before managing to leave the scene . \n",
       "  xxunk the available evidence , including xxup m.p. 's statement of 20 xxmaj july 2001 ( see paragraphs 34 - 36 above ) , indicated that xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death had been caused by one of the shots fired by xxup m.p. xxmaj the investigating judge cited virtually the whole of that statement , in which xxup m.p. spoke of his state of panic , the injuries he and xxup d.r. had sustained and the fact that at the moment he pointed his pistol he had not seen anyone but had been aware of the presence of attackers because of the continuous barrage of stones . xxmaj that version matched the statements made by xxup d.r. and xxup f.c. and those of other armed forces personnel and witnesses . xxmaj in addition , the case file showed that xxup m.p. had bruising and injuries to his right leg , his arm and the top of his skull ; xxup d.r. had scratches on his face and bruising on his shoulder and foot , while xxup f.c. had a post - traumatic disorder treatable within fifteen days ( see paragraphs 51 - 53 above ) . \n",
       "  2.the “ intermediate object ” theory \n",
       "  87.the investigating judge noted that the evidence in the file showed that the first bullet fired by xxup m.p. had killed xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj in exiting through the occipital bone in the skull the bullet had lost a fragment of its casing , as shown by the scan performed before the autopsy . xxmaj this fact , combined with the characteristics of the entry and exit wounds , had led the prosecuting authorities ' experts to formulate the theory that the bullet had collided with an object before hitting xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj the entry wound had been very irregular in shape and the exit wound had been small , as was the case when a bullet had lost momentum and / or fragmented . \n",
       "  88.the bullet in question was an encased 9 mm parabellum , and therefore very powerful . xxmaj this fact , together with the low resistance of the body tissue through which the bullet had travelled , served to confirm the theory advanced by the prosecuting authorities ' experts . xxmaj moreover , a “ tiny fragment of lead ” , compatible with the bullets issued to xxup m.p. , had been found in the victim 's balaclava with particles of bone attached to it . xxmaj this suggested that the bullet had lost part of its casing before hitting the bone . \n",
       "  89.the simulated shots had revealed that the intermediate object which caused the bullet to fragment could not have been either the fire extinguisher carried by the victim or one of the bones through which the bullet had passed ; on the other hand , it could have been one of the numerous stones thrown at the jeep by demonstrators . xxmaj this appeared to be confirmed by the video footage showing a stone disintegrating in the air at the same time as a shot was heard . xxmaj the fact that the sound and the disintegration of the object occurred simultaneously made the applicants ' theory that the stone had smashed on impact with the roof of the jeep less convincing . xxmaj furthermore , the lead fragment in the victim 's balaclava had borne traces of building materials . xxmaj lastly , the test shots had shown that , when they were hit by a bullet , objects made up of building materials “ exploded ” in a similar manner to that seen in the video footage and caused damage to the cartridge casing . xxmaj the tests performed showed that disintegration occurred differently when such objects were thrown against a vehicle ( the dust was produced after rather than simultaneously with fragmentation , and in smaller quantities ) . \n",
       "  90.the second shot fired by xxup m.p. had left a mark on the wall of the church on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda ( at a height of 5.3 metres ) . xxmaj the first shot had hit xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj the ballistics tests had been unable to establish the original trajectory of that bullet . xxmaj however , the experts appointed by the public prosecutor 's office had taken into account the fact that the jeep was xxunk high and that the stone seen on the video had been at a height of around 1.9 m when the image was recorded . xxmaj they had therefore fired some test shots , positioning the weapon around 1.3 metres from a stone suspended 1.9 metres above the ground : the bullet had been deflected downwards and hit the “ collecting tray ” ( located 1.75 metres from the weapon ) at heights of between 1.1 and 1.8 metres . xxmaj these data tallied with the statements of certain demonstrators who had been eyewitnesses to the events , according to whom xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had been about two metres from the jeep when he was shot dead . xxmaj the prosecuting authorities ' experts had not had these statements available to them at the time they had carried out their work . \n",
       "  91.the foregoing considerations suggested that , as concluded by the prosecuting authorities ' experts , the shot had been fired upwards , above xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani , who was 1.65 m tall . xxmaj the stone had disintegrated 1.9 metres above the ground . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk 's angle of vision \n",
       "  xxup xxunk 's angle of vision had probably been restricted by the jeep 's spare wheel . xxmaj however , it was difficult to be certain on that point as xxup m.p. 's face did not appear on any of the photographs in the file , whereas they clearly showed his hand holding the weapon . xxmaj the pictures suggested , however , that he had been half - lying ( in xxunk xxunk ) or crouching on the floor , as confirmed by xxup m.p. 's own statements and those of xxup d.r. and the demonstrator xxmaj predonzani . xxmaj that led to the conclusion that xxup m.p. had been unable to see the persons close to the jeep 's rear door below the spare wheel , and that he had fired the shots in an attempt to intimidate the demonstrators . \n",
       "  4.legal characterisation of xxup m.p. 's actions \n",
       "  xxunk thus reconstructed the facts , the investigating judge addressed the legal characterisation of xxup m.p. 's actions . xxmaj the prosecuting authorities had advanced two hypotheses in that regard ( see paragraph 72 above ) : ( a ) that xxup m.p. had fired as high in the air as possible with the sole aim of intimidating the jeep 's assailants , in which case the charge should be one of causing death by negligence ( omicidio xxunk ) ; ( b ) that xxup m.p. had fired without aiming at anyone or anything , with the aim of halting the attack , in which case the charge should be one of intentional homicide on account of “ reckless conduct ” , as he had accepted the risk that demonstrators might be hit . \n",
       "  94.the investigating judge took the view that the first hypothesis advanced by the public prosecutor was not correct . xxmaj if xxup m.p. had fired as high in the air as possible his actions would not have been punishable , by virtue of xxmaj article 53 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code ( “ the xxup cc ” ) , and the causal link would in any case have been severed by an unforeseeable factor beyond his control , namely the bullet 's collision with an intermediate object . \n",
       "  95.if , on the other hand , the second hypothesis advanced by the prosecuting authorities was accepted , it had to be established whether any grounds of justification existed ( the legitimate use of weapons and / or selfdefence , under xxmaj articles 53 and 52 of the xxup cc – see paragraphs 142 - 144 below ) which would exempt xxup m.p. from criminal responsibility and make his actions not punishable . \n",
       "  5.whether xxup m.p. made legitimate use of his weapon ( xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc ) \n",
       "  96.the investigating judge first addressed the question whether the use of a weapon had been necessary . xxmaj under xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc ( see xxunk below ) , xxmaj state agents had wider powers than ordinary individuals in the context of self - defence ; this ground of justification was not subject to the condition that the reaction was proportionate to the threat , but to the condition of “ necessity ” . xxmaj even for xxmaj state agents , the use of a weapon was a measure of last resort ( xxunk ratio ) ; however , xxmaj state agents could not be held responsible for the occurrence of a more serious event than that foreseen by them , as this risk was inherent in the use of firearms . xxmaj in general terms , xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc permitted the use of force where it was necessary to repel violence or thwart an attempt to resist official authority . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk had found himself in a situation of extreme violence designed to disturb public order and targeting the carabinieri , whose safety was directly threatened . xxmaj in that connection the investigating judge cited extracts from the testimonies of two of the jeep 's assailants ( xxmaj mr xxmaj predonzani and xxunk ) , noting once again the violence of the assault , and referred to the photographs in the file . xxmaj the victim 's conduct had not been an isolated act of aggression , but one phase in a violent attack on the jeep by several persons , who had been xxunk it sideways and probably trying to open the rear door . \n",
       "  98.the evidence in the file ruled out the possibility that xxup m.p. had deliberately targeted xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ; however , even assuming that this had been the case , in the particular circumstances of the case his conduct would have been justified under xxmaj article 53 of the xxup cc , as it was legitimate to fire in the direction of assailants in order to halt an attack while endeavouring to limit the damage , for instance by avoiding vital organs . xxmaj in conclusion , the use of a firearm had been justified and had been likely not to cause serious harm , given that xxup m.p. had “ certainly fired upwards ” and that the bullet had struck xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani only because it had been deflected in a manner that could not have been foreseen . \n",
       "  xxunk xxup m.p. acted in self - defence ( xxmaj article 52 of the xxup cc ) \n",
       "  99.the investigating judge next considered it necessary to determine whether xxup m.p. had acted in self - defence , which was a “ more stringent ” test for exemption from responsibility . xxmaj she took the view that xxup m.p. had rightly perceived a threat to his physical integrity and that of his colleagues , and that the threat had persisted on account of the violent attack on the jeep by a crowd of assailants and not just by xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj in order to be assessed in its proper context , xxup m.p. 's response had to be viewed in relation to that attack . xxmaj the investigating judge rejected the hypothesis advanced by the victim 's family that xxup m.p. 's head injuries had been caused by the internal lever of the flashing light on the jeep 's roof rather than by stones thrown by demonstrators . \n",
       "  xxup xxunk 's response had been necessary in view of the number of assailants , the means used , the sustained nature of the violence , the injuries to the carabinieri in the jeep and the vehicle 's difficulty in leaving the square because the engine had stalled . xxmaj the response had been appropriate given the level of violence . \n",
       "  xxunk xxup m.p. not taken out his weapon and fired two shots , the attack would have continued . xxmaj if the fire extinguisher – which xxup m.p. had already kicked away once – had landed in the jeep , it would have caused serious injury , or worse , to the occupants . xxmaj as to the relationship of proportionality between the attack and the response , the xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation had held that the interests under threat had to be weighed against the means available to the accused , and that a plea of self - defence might be allowed even if the harm to the assailant was slightly greater than the threatened harm to the accused ( see xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , xxmaj first xxmaj section , judgment no . xxunk of 13april 1987 , xxmaj catania ) . xxmaj furthermore , the response had to be the only one possible in the circumstances , in the sense that other responses less damaging to the assailant would not suffice to counter the danger ( see xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation , xxmaj first xxmaj section , judgment no . xxunk of 1 xxmaj december 1995 , xxup p.m. and xxmaj xxunk ) . xxmaj where a firearm was the only means of defence available to the person under attack , its use should be confined to displaying the person 's resolve to make use of it , firing into the air or onto the ground or firing in the direction of the assailant but taking care not to hit vital organs , so as to inflict injury but not kill ( see xxmaj court of xxmaj cassation judgment of 20september 1982 , xxmaj xxunk ) . \n",
       "  102.in the instant case xxup m.p. had had only one means of countering the attack : his firearm . xxmaj he had made proportionate use of it , since before shooting he had called out to the demonstrators to leave , in an attempt to put a stop to their actions ; he had then fired upwards and the bullet had hit the victim as the result of a tragic twist of fate ( per una xxunk xxunk ) . xxmaj had he wished to be sure of harming his assailants he would have fired through the side windows of the jeep , next to which numerous demonstrators had gathered . xxmaj it followed that he had acted in self - defence . xxmaj that being so , it was of little relevance whether xxup m.p. had had a partial view of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani ( as the applicants ' experts maintained and the prosecuting authorities ' experts considered possible ) or whether , as seemed more likely , he had not seen him and had fired as high in the air as his position would allow , accepting the risk that the shot might hit somebody . \n",
       "  7.the accusations against xxup f.c. \n",
       "  103.the investigating judge also considered that the evidence in the file excluded any criminal responsibility on the part of xxup f.c. , given that , as indicated by the forensic experts , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's death had undoubtedly been caused within minutes by the pistol shot . xxmaj the jeep 's driving over the victim 's body had caused only bruising . xxmaj in any event , owing to the confused situation around the jeep , xxup f.c. had not been able to see xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani or observe that he had fallen to the ground . \n",
       "  xxunk of the applicants ' requests for further investigation \n",
       "  104.the investigating judge refused all the applicants ' requests for further investigative measures to be taken ( see paragraph 79 above ) . xxmaj the reasons for the refusal can be summarised as follows : \n",
       "  ( a)with regard to the request for a forensic report to be prepared aimed at establishing whether xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had still been alive when the jeep drove over his body ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) , the checks already carried out had been thorough ; furthermore , the injured parties had been offered the opportunity of appointing an expert of their choosing to attend the autopsy , but had not availed themselves of that possibility . xxmaj in addition , the victim 's body had been cremated scarcely three days after his death , thereby rendering any subsequent examination impossible ; \n",
       "  ( b)as to the request for police chief xxmaj de xxmaj gennaro and carabinieri second lieutenant xxmaj zappia to be examined on the subject of the lawfulness of the use of “ thigh xxunk ” of the kind from which xxup m.p. had drawn the weapon ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) , it was clear that the directives issued with a view to the maintenance of public order could only be of a general nature and did not include instructions applying to unforeseeable situations involving direct attacks on officers . xxmaj furthermore , the manner in which xxup m.p. had been wearing the pistol was of no relevance in the present case given that he could legitimately make use of his weapon irrespective of where he was wearing it or where he drew it from ; \n",
       "  ( c)any attempt to identify the person who had thrown the stone which deflected the bullet ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) was bound to fail , as it was not realistic to imagine that a demonstrator would have followed the trajectory of a stone after throwing it . xxmaj in any event , it would be impossible to identify the person concerned and his or her statements would have no bearing on the technical findings in the judge 's possession ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk purpose whatsoever would be served by further examining the demonstrators xxmaj monai and xxmaj predonzani concerning the conduct of the carabinieri inside the jeep , the number of demonstrators in the vicinity of the vehicle , the person inside the jeep who had actually seized the weapon , xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's position or the number of the jeep 's windows that were broken ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) . xxmaj those witnesses had made statements very shortly after the events , while the latter were still fresh in their minds ; the statements contained extremely precise details which were confirmed by the video footage and photographs in the file . xxmaj lastly , it was not relevant to establish how many of the jeep 's windows had been broken as it was beyond dispute that some of the right - side windows and the rear window were smashed ; \n",
       "  ( e)it was unnecessary to take evidence from xxmaj mr d'auria , supposedly to confirm that no xxmaj molotov cocktails had been thrown on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , contrary to xxup m.p. 's assertion , or to determine how far away xxmaj mr d'auria had been when he took the photograph which the prosecuting authorities ' experts had used as a basis for the ballistics reconstruction . xxmaj the photograph in question had been merely a starting point for determining carlogiuliani 's position , which had been deduced from the position of the persons in relation to the fixed elements on the square . xxmaj furthermore , xxup m.p. had never asserted that xxmaj molotov cocktails had been thrown on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda ; he had simply spoken of his fear that they might be ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk regard to the request to hear evidence from xxmaj sergeant - xxmaj major xxmaj xxunk as to when the xxunk window of the jeep had been smashed , the photographs showed clearly that it had happened well before the shots were fired and that the latter had not been the cause of the smashed window ; even if the witness whom the applicants wished to see called perceived the matter differently , this would not alter those findings ; \n",
       "  ( g)the footage recorded on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda by two carabinieri whose helmets were equipped with video cameras was already in the file ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk was nothing to be gained by hearing evidence from carabiniere xxup v.m. concerning the practice of cutting the tips of bullets ( see xxunk ) above ) . xxmaj it could only be assumed that this improper practice was not widespread ; in any event , the findings of the ballistics reports , based on objective tests , were already available . xxmaj there was nothing to indicate that xxup m.p. had adopted the practice in question in this case , given that the other bullets found in the magazine of his pistol had been perfectly normal ; \n",
       "  ( i)it was beyond dispute that the damage to the jeep had been caused by the stones and other hard objects thrown at it ; it was therefore unnecessary to order a technical inspection of the vehicle ; \n",
       "  ( xxunk tests on the spent cartridges seized , in order to establish which weapons they had come from ( see paragraph xxunk ) above ) , would “ serve no actual purpose ” , as there was no doubt that the fatal bullet had been fired from xxup m.p. 's weapon ; this had been confirmed by xxup m.p. 's statements and the findings of the forensic examinations . \n",
       "  9.the decision to delegate certain investigative steps to the carabinieri \n",
       "  105.the investigating judge dismissed the criticisms made by the applicants ' lawyers to the effect that it had been inappropriate to entrust several aspects of the investigation to the carabinieri and to hear evidence from a large number of witnesses in the presence of members of the carabinieri . xxmaj the judge observed that the events on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda had been reconstructed with the aid of the large volume of video and photographic material in the file and the statements of the participants themselves , and that all plausible scenarios had been considered . \n",
       "  106.in the light of all the above considerations the xxmaj genoa investigating judge decided that the proceedings should be discontinued . \n",
       "  f.the parliamentary inquiry \n",
       "  107.on 2 xxmaj august 2001 the xxmaj speakers of the xxmaj senate and the xxmaj chamber of xxmaj deputies decided that an inquiry ( indagine xxunk ) into the events which occurred during the xxup g8 in xxmaj genoa should be carried out by the constitutional affairs committees of both houses of xxmaj parliament . xxmaj to that end , a commission representing the different parliamentary groups was established , made up of eighteen members of xxmaj parliament and the same number of senators ( “ the parliamentary commission ” ) . \n",
       "  108.on 8 xxmaj august 2001 the parliamentary commission heard evidence from the xxmaj commander - xxmaj general of the carabinieri . xxmaj the latter stated , in particular , that xxunk additional troops and 375 specialised carabinieri had been drafted in to xxmaj genoa to assist the 1,200 members of the provincial command . xxmaj only 27 % of the men present in xxmaj genoa had been auxiliary carabinieri performing military service ( for public - order operations the figure was usually 70 % ) . xxmaj most of the auxiliary carabinieri had performed nine or ten months ' service and had already been deployed in similar settings . xxmaj beginning in xxmaj april 2001 all the personnel to be deployed in xxmaj genoa had received training in public - order operations and use of the standard equipment . xxmaj team exercises and seminars had been organised , the latter relating to the identification of potential threats and the layout of the city . xxmaj all those deployed had protective helmets , riot shields , batons , gas masks and xxunk suits with protection for the most exposed parts of the body . xxmaj each carabiniere had a pistol ( xxunk xxunk ) and numerous tear - gas grenades had been issued to the detachments ; there were also 100 armoured vehicles and 226 vehicles equipped with protective grilles , in addition to the special vehicles ( for instance , vehicles fitted with mobile barriers to reinforce the fixed barriers protecting the red zone ) . \n",
       "  109.according to a memorandum from the senior command of the carabinieri , an elite force ( xxunk xxunk ) of xxunk men had undergone a programme of training in xxmaj velletri ahead of the xxup g8 summit , covering both theory ( the psychology of crowds and opposition groups , public - order techniques , handling emergencies ) and practice ( physical activity , use of resources , materials and equipment , final exercise with debriefing ) . xxmaj the remaining troops had received three days ' training in public - order techniques . xxmaj forty - eight officers had taken part in an information seminar covering topics such as the layout of the city of xxmaj genoa . \n",
       "  110.on 5 xxmaj september 2001 the parliamentary commission heard evidence from xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro , an officer of the xxmaj rome police who had taken part in the public - order operations in xxmaj genoa ( see paragraph 34 above ) . \n",
       "  xxunk xxmaj lauro stated that the carabinieri had been equipped with throat microphones , enabling them to communicate very rapidly with one another . xxmaj when asked to explain why the law - enforcement officers stationed quite near to the jeep ( fifteen to twenty metres away ) had not intervened , xxunk replied that the men had been on duty since the morning and had been involved in several clashes during the day . xxmaj he added that he had not noticed at the time of the events that there was a group of carabinieri and police officers who could have intervened . \n",
       "  xxunk to the function of the two jeeps , xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro explained that they had brought fresh supplies at around 4 p.m. and had left and then returned about an hour later to see if anyone was injured . xxmaj mr xxmaj lauro also said that he had called an ambulance for xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani as no doctor was present at the scene . \n",
       "  113.on 20 xxmaj september 2001 the parliamentary commission submitted a report setting out the conclusions of the majority of its members following the inquiry . xxmaj the document dealt with the organisation of the xxup g8 in xxmaj genoa , the political context and protest movements surrounding the summit and similar events worldwide , and the numerous contacts which had taken place between representatives of the institutions and associations making up the xxmaj genoa xxmaj social xxmaj forum , with the aim of preventing public - order disturbances and making arrangements to receive the demonstrators . xxmaj despite that dialogue , the protest movement had not succeeded in isolating the violent elements , numbering “ around 10,000 ” ; within the latter , a distinction had to be made between the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc and “ opportunistic ” individuals who had concealed themselves in the crowd . \n",
       "  xxunk thousand law - enforcement officers had taken part in the operation . xxmaj there had been about 2,000 delegates and xxunk accredited journalists ; the number of demonstrators ran into the tens of thousands ( 100,000 had taken part in the final demonstration ) . xxmaj seminars on the coordination and training of the law - enforcement agencies ( with contributions by trainers from the xxmaj los xxmaj xxunk police ) had been held on 24april and 18 and 19 xxmaj june 2001 . xxmaj the agencies concerned had staged practical exercises , albeit after a deplorable delay . xxmaj the administrative authorities had conducted research into non - lethal ammunition ( including rubber bullets ) , in particular by means of study visits to foreign police forces . xxmaj the authorities had been informed that xxmaj black xxmaj bloc demonstrators from anarchist circles in xxmaj italy and abroad were likely to travel to xxmaj genoa . xxmaj after contacts with police forces in other countries , a decision had been taken to suspend application of the xxmaj schengen xxmaj agreements between 13 and 21 xxmaj july 2001 . xxmaj from 14 xxmaj july onwards checks had been carried out at the xxmaj italian borders to allow certain demonstrators to enter the country and prevent violent elements from gaining access . xxmaj in the meantime , by an order dated 12 xxmaj july 2001 , the xxmaj genoa questore had indicated the areas of the city where the summit and the demonstrations would take place and had given an analytical breakdown of the security measures in place in each area . \n",
       "  115.the parliamentary commission next examined the various violent incidents and clashes which had taken place between the law - enforcement agencies and demonstrators on 19 , 20 and 21 xxmaj july 2001 ( in particular during a search conducted in a school , described by the commission as “ perhaps the most notable example of organisational and operational failings ” ) . xxmaj with specific reference to the death of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani , the commission observed that a carabiniere had fired the fatal shot while the victim had been preparing to throw a fire extinguisher in his direction ; the carabiniere in question had previously sustained a blow to the head from another demonstrator . xxmaj in view of the fact that a criminal investigation was in progress , the commission decided to focus its analysis on the “ overall situation giving rise to the tragedy ” , examining in particular the communications system between the contingents of law - enforcement personnel , their commanding officers and the control centres , in order to study the coordination arrangements between the different areas . xxmaj the commission also noted that the “ fundamental cause ” of the loss of a life had been “ the xxunk violence perpetrated by extremist groups which jeopardised the lives of the young people who became caught up in their criminal activities ” . \n",
       "  116.in the commission 's view , the overall outcome of the xxup g8 had been positive . xxmaj while certain shortcomings had been identified in the coordination of the operations , it had to be borne in mind that the law - enforcement agencies had been confronted with between 6,000 and 9,000 violent individuals who had not been isolated by the peaceful demonstrators ( the commission referred in that regard to the “ double game ” being played by the xxmaj genoa xxmaj social xxmaj forum ) . xxmaj the parliamentary commission 's report concluded as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj the commission ... reiterates that violence is not and must not be a tool for political action and that the rule of law is a fundamental value of democratic societies . xxmaj at the same time it emphasises strongly the inviolability of the constitutional principles of freedom to express one 's thoughts and respect for the individual even – not to say especially – where he or she is detained following arrest , and also the need to ensure the safety of citizens and public order ; if acts constituting a criminal or disciplinary offence are established , [ the commission ] would like to see the judicial authority and the administrative bodies concerned identify those responsible and punish their actions . ” \n",
       "  117.the xxmaj government produced before the xxmaj court the verbatim records of the hearings at which the parliamentary commission had heard evidence from the xxmaj minister of the xxmaj interior , the xxmaj director - xxmaj general of the xxmaj public xxmaj safety xxmaj department and the xxmaj commander - xxmaj general of the xxmaj revenue xxmaj police . \n",
       "  118.on 20 xxmaj september 2001 a group of parliamentarians called on the government to explain why law - enforcement officers being deployed on public - order operations were equipped with live ammunition rather than rubber bullets . xxmaj the parliamentarians advocated the use of the latter , arguing that they had been used successfully on several occasions in other countries . \n",
       "  119.the government spokesman replied that the legislation made no provision for that option and that , moreover , it had not been proven that rubber bullets did not also cause very serious harm to the victim . xxmaj finally , he said that the possibility of introducing non - lethal weapons was currently being examined . \n",
       "  120.on 22 xxmaj june 2006 the applicants applied to the xxmaj prime xxmaj minister 's xxmaj office and to the xxmaj ministry of xxmaj defence for compensation in respect of the damage they had suffered as a result of the death of xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani . xxmaj the xxmaj government explained that the application had been refused on the ground that it had been established in criminal proceedings that xxup m.p. had acted in self - defence . xxmaj for the same reason , no disciplinary proceedings were instituted against xxup m.p. \n",
       "  g.the decisions given in the “ trial of the twenty - five ” \n",
       "  1.the first - instance judgment \n",
       "  121.on 13 xxmaj march 2008 the xxmaj genoa xxmaj district xxmaj court published its reasoning in the judgment adopted on 14 xxmaj december 2007 following the trial of twenty - five demonstrators charged with a number of offences committed on 20 xxmaj july 2001 ( including criminal damage , theft , destroying property , looting and acts of violence against law - enforcement officers ) . xxmaj during the trial , in which 144 hearings were held , the xxmaj district xxmaj court , among other things , heard evidence from numerous witnesses and examined a wealth of audiovisual material . \n",
       "  122.the xxmaj district xxmaj court held , inter alia , that the attack by carabinieri on the xxmaj tute xxmaj bianche marchers had been unlawful and arbitrary . xxmaj the march had been authorised and the demonstrators had not committed any significant acts of violence against the carabinieri . xxmaj the attack by the latter had been launched against hundreds of persons who were doing no harm , and no order to disperse had been given . xxmaj the subsequent charge had also been unlawful and arbitrary . xxmaj it had not been preceded by a warning to disperse , had not been ordered by the officer authorised to do so and had been unnecessary . \n",
       "  123.the methods deployed had also been unlawful . xxmaj the carabinieri had fired tear - gas grenades at chest height , a large number of demonstrators had sustained injuries caused by non - regulation batons , and the armoured vehicles had knocked down the barricades and pursued members of the crowd along the pavement with the clear intention of causing harm . \n",
       "  124.the unlawful and arbitrary nature of the carabinieri 's actions had justified the resistance shown by the demonstrators while tear gas was being used and during the attack on the march . xxmaj their resistance had also been warranted during the clashes which occurred in the side streets prior to 3.30p.m . , that is , up to the point at which the carabinieri had acted on the order to stop and allow the march to proceed . xxmaj according to the court , the accused 's actions had been a “ necessary response ” to the arbitrary actions of the law - enforcement officers for the purposes of xxmaj article 4 of xxmaj legislative xxmaj decree no . 288 of 1944 . xxmaj article 4 reads as follows : \n",
       "  “ xxmaj articles 336 , 337 , 338 , 339 , 341 , 342 and 343 of the xxmaj criminal xxmaj code [ making punishable various acts of resistance against law - enforcement officers ] shall not apply where the xxmaj state agent or person authorised to exercise public authority caused the offence contemplated in those xxmaj articles by overstepping the limits of his or her authority through arbitrary acts . ” \n",
       "  125.the xxmaj district xxmaj court decided to forward the file to the public prosecutor 's office on the ground that the statements made by xxmaj mr xxmaj mondelli and two other law - enforcement officers ( to the effect that the attack had been necessary to counter the aggression shown by the demonstrators ) did not match the facts . \n",
       "  xxunk 3.30 p.m. , although the demonstrators may still have felt a sense of abuse and injustice , their conduct had no longer been defensive but had been driven by a desire for revenge ; it was therefore unjustified and punishable . \n",
       "  127.the charge ordered by police officer xxmaj lauro , which had triggered the events on xxmaj piazza xxmaj alimonda , had been neither unlawful nor arbitrary . xxmaj as a result , the violent reaction by the demonstrators , which had led to the carabinieri being pursued and the jeep being attacked , could not be regarded as a defensive response . \n",
       "  128.the carabinieri in the jeep might well have feared that they would be subjected to an attempted lynching . xxmaj the fact that the demonstrators surrounding them did not have xxmaj molotov cocktails and were therefore not in a position to set the vehicle on fire was a factor that could be appreciated with hindsight . xxmaj the occupants of the jeep could not be blamed for having panicked . \n",
       "  129 . xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani had probably been four metres from the jeep when he was shot down . xxup m.p. had stated that he could only see what was happening inside the vehicle . xxmaj when the shot was fired , he had been lying down with his feet pointing towards the rear door of the vehicle . xxmaj he had pulled xxup d.r. down on top of him and could not see his own hand ; he was unable to say whether it had been inside or outside the jeep . xxmaj in any event , he had fired upwards . \n",
       "  130.the xxmaj district xxmaj court judgment mentions the statements made by the expert xxmaj xxunk xxmaj salvi , who performed the autopsy on xxmaj carlo xxmaj giuliani 's body . xxmaj mr xxmaj salvi stated in particular that the trajectory of the fatal bullet indicated a direct shot and that the metal fragment lodged in the victim 's body had been very difficult to find . xxmaj the fragment , which had shown up on the scan ( see paragraph 60 above ) , “ must have been very small ” ; the experts had tried to locate it by going through the brain tissue section by section ( per xxunk ) , although the latter had been damaged and xxunk with blood . xxmaj the more the experts worked , the more damaged the tissue had become . xxmaj given that the fragment was not a bullet and was of no use for ballistics purposes , the experts had considered it to be a minor detail ( un particolare xxunk ) and had not pursued their search . \n",
       "  2.the appeal judgment \n",
       "  xxunk - four of the accused appealed against the first - instance judgment . xxmaj in a judgment of 9 xxmaj october 2009 , deposited with the registry on 23december 2009 , the xxmaj genoa xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal partly upheld the convictions handed down by the xxmaj district xxmaj court , increased some of the sentences and declared the prosecution of some of the offences time - barred . \n",
       "  xxunk the carabinieri attack on the xxmaj tute xxmaj bianche march , the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal largely endorsed the view of the xxmaj district xxmaj court . xxmaj it observed that the carabinieri had encountered the march , which numbered around 10,000 persons , as a result of the route indicated to them by the control room . xxmaj the front of the march , or “ contact group ” , had been made up of around twenty individuals , mostly members of xxmaj parliament , mayors , cultural figures and journalists . xxmaj behind them had been a series of xxmaj xxunk protective devices , joined together ; these were followed by the “ head of the procession ” made up of demonstrators equipped with helmets and shoulder and arm protectors . xxmaj the march had not encountered the scenes of any clashes but had simply proceeded for about two kilometres without meeting any obstacle . xxmaj the protective equipment showed that , although they were not carrying blunt instruments , the demonstrators had been prepared for possible clashes . \n",
       "  xxunk these circumstances it was difficult to understand why officers xxmaj bruno and xxmaj mondelli had decided to launch an attack on the march . xxmaj they had not received any orders to that effect ; on the contrary , they had been requested to avoid crossing the marchers ' path . xxmaj the news that an attack was in progress had been greeted with cries of disapproval in the control room . \n",
       "  134.the carabinieri had been summoned to intervene urgently in xxmaj xxunk xxmaj prison , where law - enforcement officers were struggling to cope with an attack by the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc . xxmaj accordingly , when they encountered the march they had attempted to clear the junction and the tunnel through which they wished to pass . xxmaj according to the witness testimony of one journalist , judged to be “ neutral ” and therefore credible , youths belonging to the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc arriving from the opposite direction to the marchers had thrown stones at the carabinieri ; this had led to the order to fire tear gas , given by xxunk . xxmaj the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal concluded that , although the charge by the carabinieri had been illegitimate , they had been called upon to intervene in a situation characterised by violence from the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc demonstrators , who had earlier ransacked other parts of the city , and by the fact that the junction they needed to cross was occupied by the crowd and the tunnel was blocked by barricades . \n",
       "  135.in the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal 's view , the xxmaj district xxmaj court had correctly found the following actions by the carabinieri to be illegitimate : \n",

       "  xxunk , there had been arbitrary acts in the form of : the use of non - regulation batons ( xxunk ) ( pieces of wood or iron wrapped in adhesive tape and a source of serious cuts and bleeding ) ; the use of armoured vehicles to make “ xxunk ” amidst the demonstrators , pursuing some of them at high speed along the pavement ( the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal observed that the vehicles did not have sufficiently safe brakes and that one of them had pursued a demonstrator in xxunk fashion , as if attempting to run him over ) ; the infliction of excessive injury and the beating of demonstrators , journalists and an ambulance driver . \n",

       "  138.the xxmaj court of xxmaj appeal endorsed the xxmaj district xxmaj court 's view that , despite their violent response , the marchers had not been guilty of the offence of criminal damage . xxmaj the damage caused had been minor and had resulted from the use of objects ( cars and refuse containers ) as protection against the carabinieri . xxmaj unlike the xxmaj black xxmaj bloc , the xxmaj tute xxmaj bianche had not taken to the streets with the intention of damaging public or private property symbolising the system they opposed . xxmaj the damage had been confined to the fairly small area in which the response had occurred and , by and large , had ceased with the withdrawal of the carabinieri . xxmaj although “ disquieting ” , the fact that the demonstrators in the front lines had worn protectors could not give rise to the assumption that they had intended to engage in acts of violence . \n",
